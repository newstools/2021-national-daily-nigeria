Reassurances poured in at the stakeholders meeting between the southwest governors, some meber of the Nigeria Governors Forum, and Miyetti Allah that took place in Ondo on Monday.
NGF’s Chairman and Ekiti Gov Kayode Fayemi who coordinated meeting told the embattled cattle breeders that Ondo Gov Rotimi Akeredolu order to leave the states forest reserve was misunderstood as eviction notice.
“This is your home. You’ve lived here, married and done business with us. Nobody is going anywhere. The statement by the Ondo State Government had no eviction reference,” Fayemi was quoted as saying to the herdsmen leaders.
The spate of kidnapping, killing and farmland destruction in the state and across the nation have been blamed on criminals among the Fulani herders in their settlements.
Following the Akeredolu order, an agitator in Oyo, Sunday Adeyemo, gave a similar order to herdsmen at Igangan, which was later followed by violence last Friday.
Reactions have since trailed Fayemi’s sweetheart response.
Already fingered as one of the good boys of President Muhammadu Buhari, Fayemi is also said to be eyeing the 2023 presidency. Little surprise then he was assuring the Fulani herders, some of his critics say.
Others present at the meeting were Osun, Oyo, Kebbi, and Jigawa governors.
