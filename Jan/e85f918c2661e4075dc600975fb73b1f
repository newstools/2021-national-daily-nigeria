A group under aegis of South-East APC Presidency Project 2023 has berated the All Progressives Congress (APC), over the composition of a 10-man national committee for membership registration/revalidation without any member of the region appointed into the committee.
In a statement by the group’s National Coordinator, Chinedu Jideofo-Ogbuagu, the group noted utter disbelief that the National Caretaker Committee the All Progressives Congress (APC), on 12th January 2021 inaugurated a 10-man national committee for membership registration/revalidation without even one South-Easterner in the Committee.
“We would rather believe that this was a careless oversight on the part of the persons who compiled that list. And we expect that the Governor Mala Buni-led National Caretaker Committee will now correct that reckless error.
“We will not request that anyone already inaugurated should be removed to accommodate the South-East. Rather, we hereby call for immediate increase of the number of members of the Mobilization Committee to 12 and two South-Easterners also appointed and inaugurated.
It said like in the other five geopolitical zones, proper mobilization for membership registration/revalidation must hold in the South-East APC and only South-Easterners will be welcomed to lead the process in that geopolitical zone.
