Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum, has cautioned Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State over his opposition to the use of coronavirus vaccine in Nigeria. The NGF chairman warned the Kogi State governor to tread with care in his statement that the COVID-19 vaccines are being introduced to kill people. 
Governor Bello had recently declared that COVID-19 vaccines were produced less than one year of coronavirus outbreak after the world had been told that there was no cure for the virus. Governor Bello had, therefore, resisted the administration of coronavirus vaccines on Nigerian citizens, saying: “they want to kill us all.”
Governor Fayemi on Thursday condemned the Kogi State governor, telling him not to risk the lives of the citizens.
The Ekiti State Governor had noted that “though, the Governor of Kogi State has a right to his reservations, the most appropriate to respond to a matter of such import is not to be dismissive.”
The Ekiti governor stated that majority members of the Nigerian Governors Forum believe that COVID-19 is real, insisting that there is a need to tackle the challenges that have emanated from the coronavirus pandemic.
Governor Fayemi stated COVID-19 is not just a health issue, and that it behooves on public office holders to work in concert with the federal government to get to the bottom of the problem which is not peculiar to Nigeria.
