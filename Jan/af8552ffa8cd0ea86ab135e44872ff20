The Magistrate court in Abuja on Monday ordered the remand of Omoyele Sowore and four others at Kuje Correctional Centre till January 5, 2021 when their formal bail application will be heard.
He is being arraigned alongside four others by the Federal Government on three charges of criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and attempting to incite others.
Sowore was arrested by the police for leading a protest against bad governance on New Year’s Eve in Abuja.
Earlier reports suggested that the protesters were injured before they were detained at the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) unit in the capital city.
The former presidential aspirant had before the protest charged Nigerians on Twitter to hold a crossover protest by picking up a candle and a placard showing their grievances against the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.
“How about a CrossOver Protest/Uprising tonight? Anyone willing to participate?” he posted on his official Twitter account.
Sowore has had several brushes with the law in recent times. He is still serving bail conditions for threatening to sack the Muhammadu Buhari led federal government with his ‘Revolution Now’ protest of 2019.
Sowore, who alongside the other accused pleaded not guilty to the charges, was detained for over 100 days in 2019.
