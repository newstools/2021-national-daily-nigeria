Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folasade Adefisayo, announced this on Monday in a statement by the Head, Public Affairs, Ministry of Education, Kayode Abayomi.
She said this was in line with the Federal Government’s directive coupled with the second wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
“All public and private schools below the tertiary level in Lagos State should be reopened for the second term 2020/21 academic session from Monday, 18th of January, 2021.
“Schools should have flexible plans where students and teachers who feel sick can teach or learn from home via available online platforms. Schools should also strive to avoid any COVID-19 infection among all students and staff,” the statement read in part.
She also asked all schools to make efforts to comply with all the outlined COVID-19 requirements for resumption of schools.
