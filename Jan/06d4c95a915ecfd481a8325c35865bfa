Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has got a shot of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Dele Momodu, the publisher of Ovation, shared Twitter pictures showing Atiku receiving the jab in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
Atiku’s spokesman, Paul Ibe, also confirmed the news.
“The importance of the #COVID19 vaccine in mitigating the effect of the coronavirus cannot be overstated, particularly in Africa and Nigeria. Yesterday (Wednesday), as part of the mass vaccination programme, His Excellency Atiku Abubakar received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,” he said.
Atiku had in a New Year Day message hoped “the vaccine(s) would soon be available for vaccination in Nigeria, and that very soon life would return to normal’.
Nigeria is hoping to get 42 million doses of the vaccine early in the year.
At a press conference of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, on Tuesday, the Federal Government said it hoped to get 42 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to battle coronavirus in the country.
“Through Covax facility, we expect to receive approximately 100,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by the end of January. A letter announcing this allocation is being expected this week,” said the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency Executive Director Faisal Shuaib.
