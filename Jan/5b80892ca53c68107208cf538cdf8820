An expert on blood disorders at Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Jerry L. Spivak, on Tuesday expressed suspicion that Pfizer vaccine allegedly killed a Florida medical doctor. Spivak was gathered to have spoken to the New York Times on Tuesday, saying that he believes “it is a medical certainty” that Pfizer’s COVID vaccine caused the death of Dr. Gregory Michael.
It was gathered that the Florida Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are investigating the death of a Florida doctor on January 3, 2021 developing a rare autoimmune disorder on December 21, 2020, three days after he was given Pfizer COVID vaccine.
The wife of Dr. Gregory Michael, Heidi Neckelmann, was gathered to have protested that she is convinced that her 56-year-old husband’s death was “100% linked” to the vaccine.  Dr. Jerry L. Spivak of Johns Hopkins University has supported Heidi Neckelmann claim that Pfizer’s vaccine killed Dr. Gregory Michael. He pointed out that Pfizer vaccine administered on Michael made him develop acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which killed him.
“Dr. Jerry L. Spivak, an expert on blood disorders at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in Dr. Michael’s care, said that based on Ms. Neckelmann’s description, ‘I think it is a medical certainty that the vaccine was related.’
“‘This is going to be very rare,’ said Dr. Spivak, an emeritus professor of medicine. But he added, ‘It happened, and it could happen again,’” New York Times had cited Spivak to have said.
Spivak was said to insisted that he based his reasoning on the fact that Michael’s disorder came on quickly after the shot, and “was so severe that it made his platelet count ‘rocket’ down.”
