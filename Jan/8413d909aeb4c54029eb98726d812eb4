Borno Gov Babagana Zulum  has waded into committee of free-wheeling advisers of those seeking power in the 2023 presidential election.
But the governor is worried because Nigeria got something fundamentally wrong: the lower age limit: 40.
“Let me state here that I have a problem with the age limit set at 40 [for presidency], because whatever is the logic behind it, it is difficult to consider it valid in contemporary times,” he said at the 17th Chief Gani Fawehinmi Annual Lecture in Lagos on the weekend.
President Muhammadu Bhari assented to the Not-too-Young-to Run Bill that brought down the eligible age to 40 in the run up to the 2019 presidential election.
Zulum also counselled the south-south and southeast politicians whining about the north not yielding power to them.
He said only God gives power.
“I said this because I have heard many people say ‘they don’t want to give us power’ but assumptions and projections will never actualise your aspirations. We must all remember that God gives power but human beings negotiate for it,” he said.
