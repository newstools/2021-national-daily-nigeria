The Nigerian government on Friday demanded thorough investigation into the killing of a Nigerian youth in Ireland.
Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), had in a statement by Abdur-Rahman Balogun, NIDCOM Head of Media and Public Relations, condemned in strong terms the killing of a 27-year-old Nigerian in Ireland, George Nkencho, by a security operative. She decried the murder of the young Nigerian by a Police officer as callous and wicked.
Dabiri-Erewa, therefore, called for a full, thorough, and fair investigation into the killing by the authorities in Ireland.
The Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), however, appealed to the angry Nigerian community in Ireland to exercise patience and await the outcome of an investigation into the killing. Dabiri-Erewa condoled with the family of Nkencho and the Nigerian community in Ireland over the killing of George.
It was gathered that the African Advocacy Network Ireland (AANI) had ion strong terms condemned the shooting dead of George Nkencho last Wednesday.
The Network protested that the circumstances surrounding the killing of a mentally challenged young man has enraged the African community and demanded a full independent public inquiry.
Stakeholders protest that the circumstance of the killing of the 27-year-old Nigerian, George Nkencho, is unclear, insisting on the investigation of the Police officer involved in the murder.
