As the Stingy Men Association of Nigeria continues to trend, it appears not all men agree with the group.

The men who feel contrary are forming themselves into groups that are in direct contrast to the slogan of the SMAN, which is ‘I will see what I can do.’

New daddy and Kokomaster, D’Banj has been made the president of a group called, Cheerful Givers Association of Nigeria. Their slogan is ‘… Because African women are worth it.’

The group was floated by Afrobeat musician, Seun Kuti, who is the national chairman and global convener.

DJ Spinall has joined the trend as he announced his membership of the Lavish Boys Association. Their slogan says, ‘send your aza sharply’.

Veteran comedian, Ali Baba has aligned with a younger colleague, Mc Lively on the No Money Men Association platform.

Posting his membership card of NMMA, Ali Baba said, “Me, I’m not stingy oooo. Money no dey to stingy with sef…”

Understandably, the NMMA motto reads, ‘I forgot my wallet at home.’

Other associations include Men That Give Association and the Generous Men Association of Nigeria.

Meanwhile, women are not left out of the association-forming spree.

They have formed associations such as the Close Legs Association of Nigeria, Stingy Women Association of Nigeria and more.
