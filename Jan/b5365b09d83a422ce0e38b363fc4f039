Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Sunday revealed that not all the 20 million citizens resident in the state will receive the coronavirus vaccine which the federal government is preparing to impose on Nigerians. The governor in an interaction on Channels Television stated that his administration does not need to vaccinate over 20 million residents of the state against corona virus infection.
Sanwo-Olu was cited to have declared: “It is important for me to make this. We don’t have to vaccinate the 20 or 22 million population that we have. The plan is to ensure that there is herd immunity and that typically speaks about 50 to 60 per cent of your population, that is the kind of target that you really meet.
“We have started a conversation with some of the vaccine manufacturers. Pfizer for example, I have made contact with them, Johnson and Johnson are not out yet, the Moderna has written to us and we have written back to them.”
