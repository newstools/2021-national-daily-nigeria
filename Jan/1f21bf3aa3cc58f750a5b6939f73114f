Bandits have sustained the rage of bloodshed in northwest Nigeria as the Boko Haram terrorists lay siege on northeast Nigeria in defiance of the security apparatuses of the Nigerian government. The bandits continue to kill innocent citizens in the various states of northwest Nigeria without restraint, including security operatives.   A gang of bandits invaded Janbako village in Maradun Local Government Area of Zamfara State and killed about 10 persons, forcing hundreds of residents to flee their homes for safety.
It was narrated the bandits, over one hundred of them, invaded the community on 50 motorcycles at about 10.25 am on Sunday, shooting sporadically, and engaging the locals in gun battle. About 10 persons were identified to have been killed in the mayhem as the local vigilantes engaged the bandits in gunfire, overpowering five of the invaders.
The locals were said to have run into the bush for safety on sighting the bandits in the community. The bandits, accordingly, were shooting at the fleeing residents, which led to the death   of the 10 people. The bandits were said to have abducted a few other persons who were taken in the forest as they escaped.
However, a combined team of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police was said to have intervened urgently on receiving the distress call and forestalled the attack from escalating. The security operatives repelled the bandits who fled on their arrival.
In another incident, bandits had last Friday ambushed a convoy of 16 police officers in Kano, killing 4 and kidnapping one. The surviving 11 policemen were, however, able to overwhelm the bandits and forced them to flee with gunshots into the forest.
