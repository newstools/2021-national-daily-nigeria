It’s very likely loggers plying their illegal business in the belly of Ogun forest bordering Ondo made effort to build a bridge estimated as N20 million—an amount that suggest how dangerous ad illegal the construction is.
Ogun Gov Dapo Abiodun has ordered the bridge, which is meant to connect the Oluwo river to and Omo Forest in Area J4 to a village in Ondo, demolished.
On Saturday, the state Commissioner for Forestry, Hon. Tunji Akinosi was said to have led a monitoring team to Laagan village where he saw the 50-metre long bridge.
A statement by the Information Officer of the Ministry, Soji Solarin, stated that the Commissioner ordered that the bridge, which is almost completed, be destroyed within two weeks.
The commissioner said those constructing the bridge were doing so to have easy transportation of stolen state’s forest resources by illegal loggers and taken away to neighbouring states.
He disclosed that some unscrupulous elements are behind the illegal bridge, saying it must have gulped about N15 million to N20 million.
He threatened to arrest and prosecute settlers keeping illegal arms to perpetrate crimes in the area.
“Armed soldiers would remain part of the frequent monitoring exercises in order to prevent banditry which is becoming prevalent nationwide,” he said.
