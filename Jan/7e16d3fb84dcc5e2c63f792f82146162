No fewer than 400 members of the APC at Ubakala, Umuahia South, in Abia dumped the party for the ruling PDP on Thursday.
The defectors were led by the APC Vice Chairmanship candidate in the December 18th 2020 LG poll held across the state, including executive members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.
Speaking on behalf of the PDP decampees during the declaration ceremony, Comrade Ifeanyi Duke, expressed joy they joined the ruling PDP in the state.
According to him, they were motivated to join PDP because of the massive development executed by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu-led administration, as well as the excellent performance of the Secretary to the State Government, Barrister Chris Ezem.
Hon. Jerry Uzosike, representing Umuahia South State constituency in Abia House of Assembly and the Executive Chairman, Umuahia South Local Government Area, Engr Humphrey Chukwudi Benson, welcomed the defectors and promised to work with them, as well as carry them along.
The PDP leaders commended them for the bold step and described their defection from APC to PDP as symbolic.
Sen Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu (APC)and Sen Theodore Orji Kalu (PDP) are from Abia in the current National Assembly.
