The new agitator from the southwest that ordered Fulani herders out of his home town Igangan, Oyo, has got his house torched days after his followers destroyed the house and cars of the Seriki n Fulani of the state.
But Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho has showed some calm about it.
IGP Mohammed Adamu immediately ordered his arrest a day after the Fulani leader and his family were hounded out of the town, and Igboho boasted nobody can arrest him.
Now that his own house at the Soka area of Ibadan has been burnt many expected the blame to be laid squarely on the Fulani staging a reprisal. Not yet.
Sunday said the attackers are no herders.
“I cannot blame anyone right now for the attack, not even Fulani people,” he said by telephone with Sahara Reporters hours after the attack
The Oyo State Police command expected to apprehend Igboho as ordered by the IGP also echoed a similar line.
Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Mr. Olugbenga Fadeyi in a statement said the arsonists are hoodlums who went to the house in a Hummer bus and a Micra car.
Fadeyi maintained that a mini sitting room in Igboho’s house was affected by the fire.
.“A mini sitting room got burnt in the process while other property are yet to be estimated. Immediately the DPO Sanyo got information about the incident, he contacted the Fire Service while he also went to the scene for on the spot assessment,” said Fadeyi
“Investigation has commenced into the incident while the police is on the trail of the hoodlums.”
A meeting took place between the southwest governors and Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria on Monday—to resolve the crisis in Igboho which followed Gov Rotimi Akeredolu’s quit order to the herders in Ondo forest  last week.
