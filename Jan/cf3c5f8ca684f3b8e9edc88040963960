Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed has contradicted the statement credited to the PTF on Covid-19—that the federal government is considering fresh lockdown as covid-19 infection spikes.
Mohammed said the Federal Government has no plan to impose a fresh lockdown on Nigeria.
“However, the Federal Government is very unhappy that Nigerians are not adhering to the basic Covid-19 protocols of wearing face masks, or practicising social distancing, of washing hands, of ensuring that they do gather in large numbers,” he said in Lagos o Monday.
“If we do not do these, the surge will continue and with the new strain of Covid-19 which is becoming much more difficult to handle than the old strain, the Federal Government will continue to insist and encourage Nigerians to please obey the Covid-19 protocols.
The coordinator of the presidential task for Dr. Sani Aliyu said during the Sunday daily briefing that lockdown is an option as the infection spread faster, and the health system is getting overwhelmed.
The likelihood of total restriction has been stirring fear and anxiety among Nigerians.
“The Federal Government is aware of the economic and social implications of a second lockdown but we want to call on Nigerians to help us, help themselves and help the economy, by adhering strictly to the Covid-19 protocols.”
Nigerians experienced a lot of hardship, and the economy tanked last year following months-long lockdown the federal government imposed when the covid-19 pandemic spread to Nigeria last March.
