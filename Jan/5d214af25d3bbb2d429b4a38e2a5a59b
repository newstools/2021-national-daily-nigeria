Lagos, Abuja, and Plateau will soon go on lockdown as the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 moves to stem the rising second waves of the pandemic. But it won’t be total.
PTF National Incident Manager, Mukhtar Muhammed, stated this on Friday on Channels TV.
According to him, data from the NCDC showed that urban local governments in the affected places recorded the highest cases of Covid-19.
The centre revealed that Lagos (46,935 cases), Abuja (16,470 cases), Plateau (7,801) have recorded the highest number of Covid infections and fatalities in Nigeria in the last eleven months.
Muhammed said the federal government wants economic activities to continue but in a regulated manner.
“We have been analysing the data and we have been looking at the geographical areas that have been most affected and the different age groups,” he said.
“A couple of weeks back, we analysed the data and we identified the hotspot local government areas.
“Mostly, the areas affected are the urban local governments in Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna, Plateau. Even in most other states, it is the urban areas that are involved. So, if we are going to have any restriction, it will be in these areas.”
Nigeria has been pushing for a pharmaceutical means—vaccine—to control the spread of the viral diseases, but using non pharmaceutical efforts like social distancing and face mask in the interim.
