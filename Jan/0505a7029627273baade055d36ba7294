Chairman of the Oyo chapter of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders of Nigeria, Alhaji Ibrahim Jiji, has said many Fulani people from the North are now afraid to visit the Southwest for fear of being attacked.
Jiji disclosed this while reacting to the eviction order handed down to Fulani herdsmen in Igangan in Ibarapa North Local Government area of Oyo state by Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho.
Alhaji Jiji appealed to Governor Seyi Makinde to ensure the arrest Sunday Igboho to foster unity in the state and avoid a major crisis that could lead to bloodshed.
Jiji begged Makinde to consider Fulani people as his children, saying Yoruba people are doing well in other parts of the country and not being intimidated.
According to him, many Fulani people in the North are now afraid to visit the southwest states for fear of being attacked.
“We want the government to arrest Igboho now. He is not more powerful than the whole country. We want Makinde to consider us as part of his children. We also voted for him in 2019 and we want him to extend his hand of fellowship to us.
“Many of the affected people cannot recognise their family roots in the North again. In fact, many of them have not gone to their villages before. We are ready to work with the Oyo State government to maintain peace and order,” he said.
