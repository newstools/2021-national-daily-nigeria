After mega businessman Atiku Abubakar revealed the APC government was messing with Intels Nigeria Limited, and he had to pull out his investment, the company has come out to refute the claim.
Intels explained that it has always operated according to market logic.
“Intels Nigeria Limited and its parent company, Orlean Invest Holding, in relation to some statements that appeared in the press yesterday and today, categorically deny that its business has at some time been hindered by political influences from the current government,” it said a statement  January 5
“The company has always operated according to market logic, thanks to its history and commitment to the development of the Nigerian economy in the oil and gas logistics sector.
“The ongoing contradictions are part of a natural commercial divergence, which will hopefully be resolved, as in the past, by a new approach, in the interest of all the parties, also according to the social role that Intels plays in the country.”
Paul Ibe, the media adviser to the ex- V.P said on Monday Atiku pulling out of Intels assumed greater urgency in the last five years, because the APC governmet has been preoccupied with destroying a legitimate business that was employing thousands of Nigerians because of politics.
“He has sold his shares in Intels and redirected his investment to other sectors of the economy for returns and creation of jobs. There should be a marked difference between politics and business,” he said.
The transactions were executed through Guernsey Trust, in deals that began in December 2018 and concluded in 2020.
