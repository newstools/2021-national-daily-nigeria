The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday commiserated with Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State over the death of his highly revered father, Chief Arthur Okorie Uzoma Okowa.

 


The PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, described Chief Arthur Okowa’s death as a huge blow not only to the Okowa family, but also to Delta State and the nation at large, particularly, as he exited the stage at this time when the state and our nation need his prayers, wise counsel and encouragement the most.
“Chief Arthur Okowa was a patriotic Nigerian and shining example of honesty, hard work, humility and love, who committed his active years to the good of humanity and the service of God,
“Though we mourn, we found comfort in the fact that Chief Arthur Okowa ran a good race before God, lived a fulfilled life and bequeathed to us a statesman in Governor Okowa, whose commitment to the welfare and development of his state, our party the PDP and our nation at large, has been outstanding,” PDP declared.
The PDP, therefore, consoled Governor Okowa, the entire Okowa family, the Owa-Alero kindred, as well as the people of Delta State, and prayed God to grant everyone the fortitude to bear the huge loss.
