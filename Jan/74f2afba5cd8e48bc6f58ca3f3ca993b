The Chibok community in Borno is in high spirits after many of the children Boko Haram kidnapped in 2014 escaped during a military raid on the terrorists’ hideouts in the Sambisa forest on Thursday.
That’s how the story is spreading in that corner of the north-eastern state, though the federal government has yet to confirm this.
Some of the girls, according to the Daily Post, have found their way home while others are with the military.
Locals said they don’t know the exact number of those that escaped, but it’s a good thing they broke out of their bondage.
Some of the girls, including those married to the terrorists, have contacted their parents.
Government officials in Maiduguri also said they heard the rumour of the escape but are nobody has contacted them.
