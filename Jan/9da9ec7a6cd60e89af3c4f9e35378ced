In its efforts to manage the upward spiral in the rate ofcovid-19 infection, the federal government has reshuffled quarantine protocols for all international travellers.
Henceforth, travellers are required to conduct a mandatory COVID-19 test within 96 hours before departure. They are also expected to repeat the PCR test seven days after arrival.
The COVID-19 Presidential Task Force made this known on Tuesday via its Twitter handle.
“Revised Protocol: All International travellers arriving Nigeria must conduct a mandatory COVID-19 PCR test within 4 days (96 hours) before departure,” it tweeted.
Earlier, travellers – except those from the United Kingdom and South Africa – are expected to conduct a mandatory PCR test within 120 hours before departure.
“All intending travellers to Nigeria must have tested NEGATIVE for COVID-19 by PCR in the country of departure pre-boarding,” part of the protocols on its website read.
Since Europe and America slid into the second wave of the pandemic last December, the rate of the covid-19 spread has nearly doubled in Nigeria, with daily records averaging 1000—and more deaths.
