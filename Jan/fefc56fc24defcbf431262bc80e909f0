The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria is happy Aso Rock has waded into the Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu-Fulani herdsmen crisis in Ondo.
The Secretary-General, the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Usman Baba-Ngelzerma, said this Wednesday.
What the Presidency said is the right thing to be done. The Presidency has emphasised the role of the constitution, no more, no less,” he told the Punch.
According to Baba-Ngelzerma , the herdsmen in the state have not yet received any official communication asking them to leave—as Akeredolu gave them seven days to leave the Ondo forest reserves and stop grazing in cities..
“No order has been given to the leadership of the herdsmen for them to vacate. I have spoken with the chairman and so we are waiting for what the state government will say but right now they are living peacefully with their host community where they are.”
Garba Sheu, the edia aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, stated in a press release Monday that it was unconstitutional for Akeredolu to ask Fulani herders to leave because of the atrocities of the criminal ones among them.
The Ondo government and Aso Rock have since engaged in a bitter back-and-forth over the matter.
Akeredolu had on Monday issued a statement, giving herdsmen seven days to vacate all forest reserves due to the high rate of kidnapping in the state.
