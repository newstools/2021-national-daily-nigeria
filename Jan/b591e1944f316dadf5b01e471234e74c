After two notable pre-campaign events, the foot soldiers of the APC national leader Bola Tinubu made another move in their ground work for the 2023 presidential election.
A band of 20 state speakers, current and former, across the southwest converged on Ibadan to drum support for Tinubu on Jan. 13.
Among those present are Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, former Speakers of Osun State House of Assembly, Hon. Mojeed Alabi and Hon. Najeem Salam, former Speaker of Oyo State House of Assembly, Hon. Asimiyu Alarape and former speakers from Ondo and Ekiti, among others.
The event came after the Southwest Agenda—SWAGA—visited traditional rulers I the state last year—for the same reason.
According to Obasa, the convener of the meeting, the speakers are fully involved in the Tinubu project, and they are expected to go back to their states to work harder to make the agenda a reality.
At the meeting, the national coordinator of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Movement,  Ambassador Aliyu Saulawa, emphasized that the movement is ready to ensure power shift to the southwest—for Tinubu.
“That Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, being a Yoruba man with the capacity, experience and means should be the candidate to be supported to emerge as the next president of Nigeria.
“That Asiwaju Tinubu still needs to do more networking in Yoruba land, especially amongst serving and past governors so that voices of dissent can be reduced to the barest minimum.
“That all stakeholders here present should go back home and start the Asiwaju Tinubu presidential project pending when he will come out public to agree to contest.”
Tinubu himself has yet to declare his intention to contest, despite armies of supporters already in fight mode to ensure he wins the election.
