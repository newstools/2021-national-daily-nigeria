Nigeria will be able to access COVID-19 vaccine by the end of February.
The Nigeria Governor s Forum in a communique signed by its Chairman, Kayode Fayemi claimed efforts are ongoing with the World Bank to ensure Nigeria assess the vaccines.
The communique was issued after a virtual meeting of state governors.
Fayemi was briefing the governors about his meeting with Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Chair of the Board of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) on the roll-out of the vaccines.
According to him, there is an arrangement for the World Health Organisation (WHO) “to facilitate pooled procurement and the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across developing countries.
“Nigeria is among 12 countries in Africa that have indicated its readiness of the 92 qualified countries for the facility and will by end of February 2021 receive its first shipment of vaccines,” he said.
The Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 warned earlier the doses will come in batches, starting with 100,000 vials, and later supplies will only cover 40 percent of Nigeria.
