The Sultan of Sokoto, HRH Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar III, has condemned the broad brush Nigerians use to paint the Fulani ethnic group in the country.
That some Fulani, seven out every 10 he said, are bad guys and kidnappers doesn’t make all Fulanis or their herdsmen kidnappers.
Abubakar disclosed this on Friday in Abuja at a meeting of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association (MACBAN).
“I am a Fulani, and I am not a bad man. I am also not a criminal. Those engaged in one forms of crimes or another are across the country. It is not proper to refer to any tribe to describe individuals’ crime,” he said.
“For example, when they collected N10m, where and how do you spend this amount in the bush? The money is back in the city. I have told the Inspector General of police to check this.
“We are not saying Fulanis are not part of the kidnappings as mentioned by the Secretary of Miyetti Allah; seven to eight kidnappers arrested are Fulanis, but that doesn’t mean ever Fulani is a criminal, no they are not.
“We must put hands together to bring an end to this problem. We are going to approach the President to talk to our West African neighbours where we have Fulanis like Senegal, Niger Republic Guinea and Mali, to help us because most of these bandit cross from neighbouring countries conducted their criminal act and run back.”
The meeting came amidst upheavals the ultimatum Ondo Gov Rotimi Akeredolu and Sunday Igbhoho, an ethic agitator, gave Fulani herders living in Ondo’s forest reserves ad Igangan, Oyo, weeks ago.
