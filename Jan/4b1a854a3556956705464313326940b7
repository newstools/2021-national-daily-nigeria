The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has refuted reports of mass disconnection of telephone lines in relation to the National Identity Number (NIN) registration across the country. The Commission stated that there are no plans to Mass Disconnect Telephone Subscribers because of the linking of SIM registration records with the National Identity Number (NIN) as directed by the federal government.
The commission in a statement on Wednesday by the Director Public Affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde, indicated that there is need to correct erroneous assumption that for every network or Sim connection, there is one unique human subscriber. The commission disclosed that a recent survey indicated that on the average, there are approximately 4 to 5 Sims to every subscriber which explains the basis for allowing the linkage of up to seven Sims to one unique NIN in the recently launched portal.
The Director stated that the ongoing registration exercise will be reviewed to ensure smooth implementation.
