Herdsmen-farmer clashes I Nigeria won’t stop until the nation makes a law banning herd movement from the north to the south.
Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje stated after a luch the APC governors had with President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina, on Saturday.
Nigeria has witnessed a surge in violent activities of Fulani herdsmen escalating in the southwest lately, leading to issuance of eviction notice and herdsmen registration, and reprisals in Ondo and Oyo.
“My advocacy is that we should abolish the transportation or trekking of herdsmen from the Northern part of Nigeria to the Middle Belt and to the Southern part of Nigeria.
“There should be a law that will ban, otherwise we cannot control the conflicts between herdsmen and farmers and cannot control the cattle rustling which is affecting us greatly,” the governor said.
His position conflicts with some of the cattle breeder. One of the two associations has insisted they own all the land in Nigeria and no one can push Fulani people round.
