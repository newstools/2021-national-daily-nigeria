The United States (US) Congress on Thursday ignored supporters of embattled President Donald Trump who besieged the Capitol on Wednesday in anti-democratic violence, to certify Joe Biden as winner of the November 2020 presidential election.
The Republican Vice President, Mike Pence, had certified the Electoral College count of 306 electors in favor of the Democrat against 232 in favor of the Republican President Donald Trump.
The Senate and House of Representatives stood firm to uphold the American democracy and public institutions and resisted the Republican plots to obstruct awarding Biden the electoral votes required for victory. The certification of Biden’s win by both chambers of the US legislature was received with high excitement in the country.
A report indicated that “the affirmation of Biden’s 306-232 victory over Trump in November, essentially, closes the door on the unparalleled and deeply controversial effort by Trump and his loyalists to overturn the results of the 2020 election.”
The certification shut Trump out of legal obstruction, compelling the outgoing US president urgently released a statement promising an “orderly transition”.
Trump was cited to have stated: “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless, there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.
“I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!”
