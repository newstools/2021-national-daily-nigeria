Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Saturday commended the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, which dismissed the certificate forgery suit against him by the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Obaseki, in a statement in Benin City on Saturday, expressed that the judgement is a triumph of the rule of law and a testament to the fact that truth would prevail ultimately no matter how vehemently detractors push lies in the face of incontrovertible evidence.
“The verdict of the Federal High Court, delivered by Honourable Justice Ahmed Mohammed, is well-received and a victory for the rule of law. It was a most needless attempt by desperate individuals trying to undo the will of the people through the back door, but we are happy today that justice and truth have prevailed.
“My profound gratitude goes to the judiciary who have stood indefatigably for truth and justice; the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR); my party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); our party leaders and members; my teeming supporters; the good people of Edo State and all Nigerians,” Governor Obaseki declared.
The Edo governor stated that the judgement has confirmed once again that Edo people were well-guided in trusting him to lead them for a second tenure in the September 19th governorship election.
He reassured of his administration’s commitment to prioritising the “development of the state not minding the darts thrown by those who are embittered by their loss and continue their attempt to put spanner in the works even when they have been roundly beaten on all fronts.”
