Nigerian governors have agreedto make a show of their covid-19 vaccination in order to tackle vaccination hesitancy.
Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, who addressed journalists in Abuja after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, said he and his colleagues had accepted to do so.
Buhari, V.P Yemi Osinbajo, and SGF Boss Mustapha are the first set of government officials to take the jabs in their arms when the first batch arrives later in January.
“We too will like to demonstrate to our citizens that we believe that vaccines would work,” said Fayemi, who is also the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum.
“Don’t forget, we have a lot of experience on this. Governors Forum managed the polio vaccines administration in the country and we have garnered a lot of experience,” said Mr Fayemi, the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum.
No fewer than four of the six governors in the southwest have bee infected with the virus. Likewise the governors of Kaduna, Bauchi, Plateau, and Abia.
