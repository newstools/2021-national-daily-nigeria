In Taraba, kidnapping has taken a new dimension: a tit for tat.
After no fewer than 26 young men were abducted days ago from Takun LGA, other youth went ahead and took hostage 31 persons of Tiv origin living in the same LGA.
Abductors of 26 youths from Takum local government area of Taraba have demanded N52 million ransom for their release.
Sources in the LGA said the Takum youths suspected the Tivs for the abduction of their kinsmen. And they have vowed to kill the 31 Tivs in their custody should anything happen to the Takum abducted.
Taraba Police spokesman DSP David Misal confirmed the kidnappers have established communication with relations of the victims.
He appealed to Takum youths to exercise patience, promising the police was making concerted efforts to secure the release of the kidnapped victims.
A LGA chairman in Taraba was abducted last week, and days later, he was found dead.
