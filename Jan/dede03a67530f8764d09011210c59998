Former Kaduna Central Senator Shehu Sani has taken same position as the presidency on the quit notice Ondo Governor Rotimi Akeredolu gave Fulani herders living in the state’s forest reserves.
The governor said all unregistered herders should vacate the state’s forest reserves in seven days, following the incessant kidnapping, killing in the axis.
Like the presidency, Sani was against the order.
“My Dear Governor Akeredolu, I’m quit aware of the security challenges facing your state. I appreciate your efforts, but it’s outrightly and completely wrong to ask all cattle herders to leave Ondo forests,” he wrote in a Facebook post.
“The sins of a criminal few should not affect the law abiding and peaceful ones who have the right to live and move freely in all parts of our country.
“Efforts must continue to be made to deal with those who breach the law, while and respecting and protecting the rights of the innocent.”
In the last two months, traditional rulers, lecturers, and others have been killed, kidnapped for ransoms in the region.
