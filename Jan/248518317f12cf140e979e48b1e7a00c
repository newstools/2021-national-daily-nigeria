A former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has revealed why the country is not working despite the huge indebtedness of the country to both foreign and local lenders.
Obi, a former vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general election, said the reason why Nigeria is not working today is that people have been recruited based on sentiment and that has to stop because the country is collapsing.
He disclosed this when he inaugurated the Isiopko Internal Roads Phase 2 in Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state, noting that  accountability in government is the most critical yardstick to determine good governance and to build the trust of the people.
“For recruitment into governance, competence capacity, and visible performance like we are seeing here today should be embraced.
He also challenged President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to point at the capital projects executed with borrowed funds for everyone to know such projects, lamenting that the Federal Government “keeps borrowing in the guise of using it for capital projects to mortgage the future of posterity.”
Obi said access roads as provided by Governor Wike to the Isiopko people would increase the quality of life they live, enhance property value and reduce poverty.
“Every day you hear Nigeria is borrowing money, and when you ask they say it is being used for capital projects. Please, we want to commission those capital projects. Let them invite us to accompany them for the commissioning. So that when our children ask us about the borrowed money, we can point to the projects to answer them,” he said.
