Less than 48 hours to the inauguration of in-coming US President Joe Biden and his V.P. Kamala Harris, some Nigerians in the United States have designed and printed  a customized fabric for the occasion that remains the most tension-filled in the country’s 244-year history.
The Nigerian “Aso Ebi”, will be won on January 20 for the inauguration sports Biden and Kamala, and an inscription: Victory Party.
A video trending online shows some Nigerians taking their Aso Ebi to their tailors.
The Nigerians, whose identity could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, said they were taking theirs to tailor.
“We will rock this. We will sweep away all those with negative mindsets out of the white house,” one of them said.
According to AFP, parades, parties, and concerts would be online or televised. Five days of events are planned, with multiple-artist concerts on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.
On Tuesday, Biden and Harris will lead virtual commemorations across the country for the 400,000 Americans dead from coronavirus.
On inauguration day they will hold a “Parade Across America,” an online 50-state tour of speakers, artists, and performers.
The main event on Wednesday night stars John Legend, Bruce Springsteen, Justin Timberlake, Ant Clemons, the Foo Fighters and Demi Lovato.
And for at-home parties, there is a curated “Biden+Harris Playlist.”
In all this, outgoing President Donald Trump, who lost re-election and is still stewing, will be missing in the highly militarised ceremony.
