Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State on Saturday defended the unpopular local government election which he said was peaceful and acceptable across the state.
Despite insinuations that the local government poll was tailored to ensure candidates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) win all the chairmanship councillorship slots, Governor after casting his vote at Ganduje Polling Unit in Ganduje Primary School in Dawakin Tofa Local Government Area, expressed satisfaction with the process, while celebrating the victory of APC candidates in all the 44 Local Government Areas of the state even when voting was yet to be concluded.
The local government election was contested by candidates of 12 political parties for the 44 chairmanship positions and 484 councillorship slots in Kano State. There were reports of voters’ apathy, hitches in distribution of voting materials to areas of influence and domination of the oppositions, including restriction of movement of many voters, among others.
