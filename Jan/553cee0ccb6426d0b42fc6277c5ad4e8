Some residents of Rigasa, Igebi LGA, Kaduna, are protesting against gross injustice by government and the senator representing the constituency.
The protest began Friday, and the citizens were chanting anti-government songs and carrying placards as they vowed to keep up the rally.
Their grievance include insecurity and demolition of their shops for which they had been paying levies to the LGA, and how Gov. Nasir El Rufai demolished the shops without notifying them.
They also complained of the Sen Uba Sani, saying he has never come to the constituency since he was elected.
The governor and the senator are members of the ruling APC.
