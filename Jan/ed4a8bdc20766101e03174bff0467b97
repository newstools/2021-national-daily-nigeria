After nine months of industrial action, the staff community of Nigerian universities are still itching to down tools again in spite of the truce the federal government just made with the teaching staff.
This time, the non-academic workers are planning to commence an indefinite strike on February 5.
The Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU made this known in a communique on Friday.
“It is in line with the resolution of our members nationwide, that the leadership of the Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU hereby resolve as follows:
“That members of NASU and SSANU shall embark on an indefinite, comprehensive and total strike with effect from midnight of Friday, 5th February 2021.
“That two weeks’ notice effective from today, Friday 22nd January 2021, is hereby given to Government and relevant stakeholders of this development,” the communique red in part.
This decision is coming when some of the universities have cancelled the 2020  session marred by strike and covid-19, and are yet to even resume.
