Media activist Omoyele Sowore and others have been arrested by the FCT command of the Nigeria police.
The Sahara Reporters publisher and his fellow activists were wrapping up a protest on New Year’s even when truckloads of police descended on them, bloodying some noses before they arrested and detained the protesters.
The arrest and detention have been linked to Sowore’s ost mobilizing for a CrossOverProtest across the nation.
“How about a crossover protest/uprising tonight? Anyone willing to participate? Pick up a candle and a placard showing your grievances against the regime; let’s upload our short videos and photos across our social media platforms. Let’s welcome the regime to a resolute 2021!,” Sowore tweeted.
‪”#CrossoverWithProtest against tyrant @mbuhari’s regime, candlelight for #LekkiMassacre; a placard for #EndBadGovernment;  procession to usher in #Revolutionary 2021, a fist for victims of repression-frozen bank accounts, malicious prosecution and detention of #Endsars activists.
“#Crossoverwithprotest starts at 11:30 till 12:30 am across Nigeria, a candle, a placard and fireworks to usher in a RESOLUTE 2021 in Nigeria! Join with your friends and   neighbours ‪#EndSARS. ‪#ObigboMassacre ‪#LekkiMassacre ‪#EndBadGoveranceInNigeria ‪#BuhariTrainwreck ‪#RevolutionNow.”
None of the protesters are reachable for now, and there has been no official statement by the police.
