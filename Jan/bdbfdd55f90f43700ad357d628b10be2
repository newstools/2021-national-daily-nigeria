A presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, Professor Kingsley Chiedu Moghalu, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, has congratulated Professor George Obiozor on his election as the President-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo. Moghalu noted that Prof. Obiozor is eminently prepared for the challenging leadership role by virtue of his distinguished track record as a scholar and public servant, having held significant foreign and domestic positions in Nigeria.
“As Nigeria’s Ambassador to the United States, Israel and Cyprus at different times, as a former Director-General of the Nigerian Institute for International Affairs (NIIA), and as a professor of international relations, Obiozor possesses the requisite leadership experience, global exposures and intellectual pedigree for the socio-cultural leadership of Ndigbo at this critical period in Nigeria’s quest for nationhood.
“I am confident his leadership of Ohaneze will foster emphasis on strategic thinking and action, positive value systems to govern Igbo society, as well as effective partnerships with other ethnic nationalities to build a nation anchored on equality, justice and equity,” Moghalu declared.
