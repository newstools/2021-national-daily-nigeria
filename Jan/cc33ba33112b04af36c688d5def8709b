The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the weekend lamented the death of a human rights activist and social crusader, expressing deep sadness over the demise of Barrister Esther Uzoma, portraying her death as a huge loss to the nation and humanity, at large.
The PDP in a statement indicated that the late Esther Uzoma, Convener of Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room, and National Coordinator of Proactive Gender Initiatives (PGI), was “a patriotic Nigerian who dedicated her life towards the entrenchment of democratic tenets, good governance, justice, equity, and fairness in all spheres of our national life.”
The PDP maintained: “Esther was a strong-willed advocate of strict adherence to the rule of law, who also remained steadfast as a voice for the vulnerable and downtrodden till the end.
“The PDP is sad that our nation has lost one of her bright and promising patriots, especially at this time such voices are needed the most in our collective quest to rescue and reposition our nation for the task ahead.”
The PDP, accordingly, commiserated with Barr. Uzoma’s husband, her children, the entire Uzoma family and the civil society fold, particularly, the Nigerian Civil Society Situation Room, as well as the Proactive Gender Initiatives, for the loss.
The party prayed to God to grant eternal repose to the faithful departed and to the bereaved, the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.
