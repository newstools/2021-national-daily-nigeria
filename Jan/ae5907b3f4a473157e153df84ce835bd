The Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere has described as barbaric and archaic the deadline issued by the federal government for telecom subscribers to link their SIM cards with their National Identification Number (NIN) despite the rising cases of COVID-19 in the country.
Nigerians have been crowding NIMC offices across the country amid COVID-19 surge to link their NIN to their SIM cards in order to avoid their telephone lines being disconnected by telecommunications firms as recently ordered by the government
In a statement signed by the group’s National Publicity Secretary, Yinka Odumakin, on Friday, therefore called for the immediate suspension of the exercise to avoid further endangering the lives of Nigerians as a result of the rush.
Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere said in the statement that officials of the NIMC who are currently on strike have also complained that they have not been provided and personal protective equipment and their allowances are not being paid.
“It is so barbaric and archaic that Nigerians are being exposed to these dangers which shows lack of critical thinking in leadership when bodies like Google etc can manage whatever information on people’s phones without having any contact with the owners”
The President of the Association of the Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, NIMC unit, Asekokhai Lucky, had in a recent interview claimed that three officials of the agency had tested positive for the dreaded virus at its headquarters with the government doing a cover-up.
Lucky had claimed that NIMC workers were annoyed because the management of the commission knew about the development but kept it from workers, who could have taken necessary precautions to protect themselves.
The Yoruba group, therefore, called on the Federal Government to respond to that allegation.
Afenifere added, “We, therefore, demand immediate suspension of the exercise until all the issues are addressed.”
