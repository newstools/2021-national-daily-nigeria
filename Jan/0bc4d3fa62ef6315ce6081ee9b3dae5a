The insecurity crisis in the northwest Nigeria has continued to escalate without restraint. Several bandits on Monday night stormed the residence of a Professor, Aliyu Mohammed, in Zaria, Kaduna State, kidnapped the lecturer and killed four persons in the attack.
The Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement on Tuesday, acknowledged the incident in Kaduna State. The Commissioner narrated that the bandits broke into the residence of Professor Aliyu Mohammed, a title holder of Waziri Wusasa, at the night, kidnapped the Professor and killed his son. He added the professor’s nephew, Abba Kabiru, was injured by the bandits in the attack.
The Commissioner further said that two members of a local vigilante group in Giwa Local Government Area were killed by bandits in another attack.
According to the Commissioner,  “Bandits on motorcycles swarmed Iyatawa Village in Giwa Local Government Area, and fortunately, groups of local vigilantes confronted the bandits and eventually forced them to disperse.
“Sadly, two of the local vigilantes, Malam Auwalu and Alassan Shehu, were killed during the encounter, as ground and air patrols were quickly mobilized to the location for a comprehensive engagement.”
The commissioner further disclosed another attack on commuters on the way from Anaba village to Birnin Yero town in Igabi Local Government Area last Sunday by bandits which resulted in one death. He said that the bandits shot one of the commuters, Lawali Abduklhameed, to death as he tried to escape from the scene of the attack.
