A serial rapist arrested by the Ondo State Security Network Agency, Operation Amotekun, Shina Adaramola, has confessed that he raped over 50 women before he was nabbed after breaking into a house in Owo local government area of the state.
46-year-old Adaramola, a bricklayer, who was arrested during the Agency’s ‘Operation Clean Up’ exercise, also confessed to have robbed over 100 houses, adding that he used charms to rape the women.
While confessing to his atrocities, Adaramola said he took to crime after his fiancée left him for another man a few days to their wedding.
“I live in Ijare. I had a fiancée who left me for another man a few days before our wedding. I became broke and frustrated and that was why I got involved in armed robbery, which was lucrative for me. Whenever there is a party, I pretend to be one of the organisers. I have a special wine opener which I use to open wine for rich people at the party. With that, I get my victims.
“I have been involved in this act for a long time since I lost everything and my landlord chased me out of his house, and my fiancée said I was not good for her anymore.
“I have raped over 50 women. Whenever I wanted to rape any woman, I always make sure I operate at night and the woman will fall for me after using charms on her. I make sure I cover the women’s faces while in the act.”
