Two of the witnesses the APC lined up against Edo PDP Gov Godwin Obaseki have tendered documents contradicting the claim by the governor he graduated from the University of Ibadan.
Professors Emmanuel Dele Balogun and Maikano Asekomhe graduated from the same university, and are disputing the originality of Obaseki’s certificate before a federal high court in Abuja.
While Balogun graduated from the agricultural economics department in 1979, the same year Obaseki claimed to have also graduated, Asekomhe graduated from the varsity’s banking and finance in 1978.
Led in evidence by the lawyer to the APC, Akin Olujimi SAN, the professors also faulted the entry qualifications of three credits in Ordinary Level WAEC and two credits in Advanced Level which Obaseki tendered for direct entry in 1976.
Cross-examining the two, Obaseki’s counsel Ken Mozia SAN, asked the two comment on his client’s certificate. They told the court they have never seen Obaseki’s certificate and so they can’t make any legal statement on what they have never seen.
They also disclosed they have never worked at the admission department of the university.
The APC lawyer then closed its case as Justice Ahmed Ramat Mohammed adjourned hearing in the suit to Tuesday when Obaseki will open his defence.
The APC and the PDP are fighting out the legal round of the Edo guber election which Obaseki, a dropout from the APC won under the PDP umbrella.
Osagie Ize-Iyamu and his APC are challenging the suitability of Obaseki—on the grounds of forged documents he submitted before the APC primary and Inec screening.
