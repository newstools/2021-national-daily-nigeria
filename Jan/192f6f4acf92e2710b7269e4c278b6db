A scammer is being tracked for defrauding a 92 years old woman of £160 in receiving fake COVID-19 vaccine in Britain. The British police commenced search for a quack on Friday who beguiled a 92-year-old woman into receiving fake coronavirus vaccine at the cost of £160. It was gathered that the British police condemned the act a “disgusting and totally unacceptable assault”.
It was highlighted that the fraudster had knocked on the door of the woman, a pensioner in Surbiton, southwest London, on December 30, under the guise of working for the state National Health Service (NHS). The suspect was said to have on entrance into her home, jabbed the woman in the arm with a “dart-like implement”; then, demanded for £160 ($217, 177 euros), which he said would be refunded.
It was said that the City of London Police, which investigates frauds and other scams, noted that it was not known what substance was injected, but the victim showed no ill effects.
Detective Inspector Kevin Ives was cited to have said, “It is crucial we catch him as soon as possible as not only is he defrauding individuals of money, but he may also endanger people’s lives.”
The British government had commenced mass vaccination of citizens on December 8, 2020, giving preference to care home residents and workers, senior citizens over 70 years, and other vulnerable people.
The Northern Ireland police was said to have cautioned internet users to beware of a phishing scam where people are told that they are “eligible” for a vaccine before being asked for bank details.
