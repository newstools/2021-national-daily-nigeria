The senior pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, says any attempt to arrest Sunday Igboho over the expulsion order to herdsmen in the Oke-Ogun area of Oyo state will hasten the disintegration of Nigeria.
The Yoruba activist, real name, Sunday Adeyemo, had last week issued a 7-day ultimatum to Fulani herders in the area to identify the criminals among them or leave the area, an ultimatum that expired on Friday.
Giwa, in a statement on Saturday warned President Muhammadu Buhari against arresting Sunday Igboho, accusing the president of not doing enough to protect citizens who are daily being killed by the murderous herdsmen in the area.
“Why didn’t IGP arrest Miyetti Allah and their representatives in Abuja? Let me inform you that Sunday Igboho is doing the right thing for the entire Yoruba nation.
“You can’t threaten, kill or arrest him unless you want to arrest all of us. When a government fails in its responsibilities to protect the citizens, people have no option than to protect themselves.
“Nigerians have tolerated Fulani herdsmen for over five years, and it is time all of us rise up to defend ourselves.”
Giwa added that only a despicable person would be happy with President Buhari’s handling of security challenges in Nigeria over the years.
Meanwhile, the Presidency has confirmed that the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, ordered the arrest of Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho.
Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, claimed the order of arrest came after the activist gave Fulani in Oyo State an ultimatum to exit the state.
“Igboho is among topics that have generated public discussion on social media in Nigeria on Friday since he visited Igangan in Ibarapa Local Government (of Oyo State) where he insisted that all Fulani residents in Oyo State must leave as long as kidnapping continues.
