Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Godswill Akpabio has reacted to reports that he paid $5million in bribe to the Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami to secure the appointment of a Sole Administrator for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).
Akapbio’s Chief Press Secretary, Anietie Ekong, insisted that the report was the handiwork of mischief-makers.
“Senator Godswill Akpabio said his attention has been drawn to a piece of fake news which claimed that he paid $5 million bribe to the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and others to secure the appointment of a Sole Administrator for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC),” the media aide said in statement.
“The Honourable Minister of Niger Delta Affairs stated categorically that ‘this is a piece of malicious concoction manufactured from the pit of hell by mischief-makers. It is a figment of the imagination of the author of the fake news. Senator Akpabio denies the story in its entirety. The authors of the fake news should be ready to back up their claim or face the full wrath of the law.’”
Malami too had earlier denied the report, saying those behind the report should provide evidence to backup their claim.
