Three members of Eiye confraternity have been arrested by men of the Ogun state police command for threatening to kill one Teslim Lateef because he refused to be initiated into their group.


The suspects identified as Olajide Shittu m’ 32yrs, Emmanuel Fidelis m’ 29yrs and Sunkanmi Ifelodun m’ 39yrs were arrested on January 28 following a report lodged at Ajuwon police station by Teslim Lateef who reported that the three suspects have been threatening to kill him for quite some time now over his refusal to be initiated into Eiye confraternity despite their persistent appeal to him.



Teslim told the police that the suspects promised to eliminate him since he has known them to be members of their group so that he will not expose them.

”On the strength of the report, the DPO Ajuwon division SP Andrew Akinseye who has been monitoring the suspects led his men to their hideout where the three suspects were apprehended. They have all confessed been members of Eiye cult group and that they were trying to recruit more members into their fold.” a statemet by the police command’s spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi reads



The state Commissioner of police CP Edward Awolowo Ajogun has ordered the transfer of the suspects to state criminal investigation and intelligence department for discreet investigation.
