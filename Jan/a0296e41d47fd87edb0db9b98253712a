Two suspects, Abdulkadir Wada, 19, and Adamu Abdulrauf, 20 arrested in Bauchi state, have confessed to killing a little girl and selling her body parts for ritual.
The suspects, in an audio clip of the interrogation confessed that a marabou (native doctor) contracted them to bring the vagina of a little girl for ritual purposes for the sum of N500, 000.
Speaking in Hausa, Wada, the chief culprit, said both he and his accomplice, Abdulrauf, had gone to Kwata, the area where the latter’s elder brother, who is married, is staying.
Upon reaching the area, they waylaid a little girl into an uncompleted building and strangled her to death.
“Abdulrauf then removed a knife from his pocket and cut off the girl’s private part. It was a marabout, who is now at large, that asked us to get him a female sexual part in return for N500,000,” he said.
On his part, Abdulrauf, denied killing their victim, saying: “It was Wada who came and met me in our house. He told me that he and one of his friends went to a spiritualist who promised them N500,000 if they brought a female vagina. But I told him I am not interested.
“So, I discussed with one of my friends called Musa who advised me to avoid Wada. The next day, while I was in my shop doing my mechanic work, I met Wada at the garage. He then gave me an amulet (charm), which I threw inside my pocket. Later on, we met and he asked me to accompany him to a place called Kwata.
“When we got to the area, we saw two young girls at a location. We stopped and called them. Wada now removed a handkerchief from his pocket and flashed it on the face of one of the girls. After the girl had slumped, he took her into an uncompleted structure, and removed her organs, as directed by the native doctor.”
