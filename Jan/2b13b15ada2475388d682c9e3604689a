the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Tuesday declared that the president is not bound by the Federal Character principles in the appointment of security chiefs. He insisted that the appointment of service chiefs is not subject to federal character.
Adesina, on Channels Television on Tuesday, was of the view that certain appointments may be subject to federal character, but security appointment is not.
According to him, “There are certain appointments that are subject to federal character, for instance, the constitution says that there must be a minister from each state of the country but there are certain appointments that are also not subject to federal character and one of them is in the security.
“In security, they are not subject to Federal Character. It is about competence; it is about the ability to deliver.
“So, the president will appoint whoever he feels is fit and proper and will deliver to the best level for the country and for Nigerians.”
Some groups had protested the exclusion of the southeast from the newly appointed service chiefs, accusing President Buhari of having hatred for the Igbo.
The new service chiefs include Major-General Leo Irabor, took over from General Abayomi Olonisakin as Chief of Defence Staff; Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao took over from Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar as Chief of Air Staff; Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo took over from Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ekwe Ibas as Chief of Naval Staff; and General Ibrahim Attahiru took over from Lieutenant General Tukur Yusuf Buratai as Chief of Army Staff.
