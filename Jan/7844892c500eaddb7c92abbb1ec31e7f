NIMC has warned Nigerians to be wary of fake NIN app created by fraudsters to harvest people’s NIN and BVN by default.
The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has warned Nigerians to be wary of fake National Identity Number (NIN) app created by fraudsters to harvest people’s NIN and BVN by default.
NIMC disclosed this via its Twitter handle on Monday when it was educating Nigerians on the difference between the fake and original app.
It tweeted, “This app was not created by NIMC or the federal government, it is run by fraudsters, who are currently harvesting people’s NIN and BVN by default. Protect your data and stop disclosing personal information to unauthorised persons or platforms.”
