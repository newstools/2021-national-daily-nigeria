The Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, CP Frank Mba, in a media interaction on Thursday, disclosed that the Police is monitoring the proceedings at the various judicial panels on restitution for victims of SARS and other related matters to make ethical adjustments in the services of the Force.
Mba on Channels television morning programme on Thursday highlighted: “We have officers monitoring and involved in the EndSARS hearing/commission sittings across the nation.
“We are documenting events in the panel and there are lessons to be learnt from the before and after acts of the EndSARS rally and coming out with customized solutions to address the issues via deepening the internal process of the Police Force towards community policing.”
