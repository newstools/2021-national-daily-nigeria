Former Kaduna Central Senator, Shehu Sani has said that both the federal government and state governors are still confused on the actual way to tackle the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
He stated this via his official Twitter handle on Monday while reacting to the resumption of schools in some states despite the surge of Covid-19 across the country.
It would be recalled that the Federal Government had fixed January 18, 2021 as the scheduled day for schools across the country to reopen. The resumption has caused fear among some Nigerians.
Sani said state governments should pay more attention in ensuring adherence to COVID-19 measures and not the Federal Government.
He further said the government was confused on how the second wave of COVID-19 should be tackled.
The tweet read: “Reopening schools and other #COVID19 regulatory measures should be a matter for the states and not the FG; the 36 states, including FCT have different infection rates. There is evident confusion on how to tackle the second wave.”
