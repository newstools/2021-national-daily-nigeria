Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has approved a reduction in the amount of  tuition for students of Lagos State University, (LASU) Ojo.
It would be recalled that students of the school had protested a hike in tuition fees by the institution’s authorities. They also demanded the reversal of the decision within two weeks.
The management of LASU last December increased the tuition fees for fresh students from N25, 000 to N67, 048.50, representing 168 per cent increase.
His Special Adviser on Education, Tokunbo Wahab, who disclosed this on Friday via his official Twitter handle, however, did not disclose the new tuition to be paid by students.
The tweet reads: “Flash: Lagos State government reduces tuition fee for students of Lagos.”
When contacted, Wahab said the approval was in tandem with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s commitment to providing qualitative education at an affordable to all and sundry, irrespective of class, gender, ethnicity, race, among others.
“Yes, the Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu has graciously approved the reduction in LASU tuition fees. An official statement will be issued in due course,” he said.
Wahab, however, explained that the move is in pursuance and fulfillment of the education agenda of the present administration as one of the pillars in THEMES agenda.
