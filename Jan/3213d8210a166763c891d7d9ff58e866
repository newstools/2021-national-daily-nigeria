An exhibit, a video disc containing information extracted from the Iphone of pop musician Azeez Fashola aka Naira Marley, has been admitted by a federal high court at Ikoyi, Lagos, as evidence in the ongoing trial of the musician o Wednesday.
Naira Marley was arraigned by the EFCC for offences bordering on conspiracy and credit card fraud.
But the suspect pleaded “not guilty” to the 11-count charge filed against him.
The court decision came after the exhibit was initially objected by the defence counsel Olalekan Ojo last February.
In his ruling, Justice Nicholas Oweibo dismissed the objection, noting that “the disk and investigation report include some of the contents extracted from the iPhone which has already been admitted in evidence”.
So prosecuting counsel, Bilikisu Buhari, then informed the court that the prosecution was ready to continue with the case as the witness was in court to continue with his testimony.
The case was however adjourned following the plea by one of the defence lawyers, Akinwale Kole-Taiwo—that  “the lead counsel was in Edo for another matter”.
Justice Oweibo then adjourned till March 8 and 11, 2021 for “continuation of hearing”.
