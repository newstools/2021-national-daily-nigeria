As part of security measures to curb kidnapping, terrorism, and other ICT-enabled crimes in Nigeria, the national identification number registration remains a routine activity for many Nigerians, and at best a requirement to get covid-19 palliatives—when actually the 11-digit number serves more purposes.
While the federal government dillydally on the duration of the current registration, owing to the covid-19 spreading at crowded registration centres, there are a number of things Nigerian need to know about NIN.
It’s not an APC administration policy, considering the fact that the process became important during ex-President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration.

NIN will aid collation and management the biodata of all Nigerian citizens and or residents into one database; and for easy access to government services.
Any Nigerian citizen, permanent resident or person who has been resident in Nigeria for at least two years, who is 16 years and above, is eligible to apply for the NIN.
NIN will enable easy passport and license application, voting eligibility, tax payment, financial and equity transaction, enrollment, and others.
Non-compliance: Failure to comply with the foregoing, attracts penalties, sanctions and or administrative fines, up to N1, 000, 000 (One Million Naira).
Required for any kind of government business to be transacted with citizens.
