The Sarikin Fulani of Igangan, Ibarapa Local Government Area, Oyo State, Salihu AbdulKadri, may be inciting Emirs and other traditional rulers in the north against the Yoruba nation after the recent uprising led by Sunday Igboho that led to his sudden departure from Oyo State. AbdulKadir in a media interaction in Ilorin, Kwara State, speaking in Yoruba language, also debunked the allegation by Sunday Adeyemo – Sunday Igboho – that he is collaborating with Fulani herdsmen involved in kidnapping in the southwest; he further refuted having any knowledge in the killing of Dr. Aborode.
He was of the view that all the allegations were fabricated by Sunday Igboho to deliberately send the Fulani out of Igangan and other parts of Yoruba land.
AbdulKadir demanded the Emirs and other traditional rulers in the 19 northern states of Nigeria to rise for the protection of the Fulani residents in the southwest.
Abdulkadir lamented that he lost N500 million assets during the attack on his home Igangan, Ibarapa.  However, he did not give details of how he amassed the huge assets that amounted to N500 million.
He, therefore, demanded the federal government to investigate the burning of his house, vehicles and the killing of seven of his men in Igangan.
