The Nigeria Governors Forum on Thursday disowned Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State over his statement expressing resistance to the use of coronavirus vaccine in Nigeria. The NGF while distancing itself from Governor Bello’s comments on the COVID-19 vaccine, however, disclosed that the governors will order inquiry into the science of the coronavirus vaccines.
Governor Bello had publicly protested the planned injection of coronavirus vaccine on Nigerian citizens, arguing that it is meant to kill the people.
Governor Bello had declared: “Vaccines are being produced in less than one year of COVID-19. “There is no vaccine yet for HIV, malaria, cancer, headache and for several other diseases that are killing us. They want to use the vaccines to introduce the disease that will kill you and us. God forbid.”
The Nigerian Governors, though, disagreeing with Governor Bello, promised that they would look to science in making decisions about the virus.
The NGF in a statement after a virtual meeting declared: “On the ill-fated pronouncement made by a member of the Forum regarding the Covid-19 vaccine in a national daily, the Forum totally and categorically dissociated itself from the statement, emphasizing that the Forum will continue to be informed and guided by science and will ensure that every decision it takes retains public and professional trust and is not compromised by conflicts of interest.”
