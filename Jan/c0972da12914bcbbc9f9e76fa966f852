Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State may have reviewed that security structure of the state, resolving to create vigilante network to complement the efforts of the security agencies of the federal government. The Edo State Government, accordingly, launched a vigilante network to strengthen security architecture so as to contain the rising insecurity crisis in the state.
It was gathered that a lead expert on the vigilante scheme, Yusuf Haruna, explained that the vigilante network is a community-based effort to encourage local communities to partner with government security agencies to protect lives and properties.
Haruna highlighted that the vigilante network is structured to co-opt key players in local communities to secure their territories, gather intelligence, build trust, and guarantee adequate security.
He  maintained that the vigilante network is intended to ensure that Edo State is safe for all with zero tolerance for cultism and kidnapping.
According to Haruna, “the mission of the vigilante network is to smoke out criminal elements and ensure that they are not comfortable in the communities.” He encouraged communities that have set up vigilante groups to work collectively for their sustenance, urging others desirous of setting up similar outfits to contact the State Government for clearance and necessary guidance.
