Liverpool’s legend and current Rangers Manager, Steven Gerrard, doesn’t think Manchester United’s Fernerdez Bruno deserves all the current accolades he’s got. The Red’s great thinks Kelvin Bryune is way above the Portuguese.


When asked what he felt about the Sunday match, he replied, “Yeah I watched the full match on Sunday and the other big six matches where Bruno was involved. Against Arsenal He was nowhere to be found. Against Tottenham he scored a Penalty as they were football taught.

Gerrard said the only player he saw in the midfield in Manchester Derby was Kevin De Bruyne, “which I believe deserves all Premier league player of the months that are given away to Bruno”.

“Against Chelsea He was absolutely inside the pocket of someone and again yesterday He was chasing Thiago but never gets no possession from him until he was substituted. For sure He miss playing against Burnley and the rest. For me He needs to perform in Premier league big matches so far not so good. This is evident why they are back in Europa league, if he was as great as claimed Man United would be in Uefa Champions League Knockout. He simply doesn’t show up in big games “.


Manchester United maintained their position at the top of the table but couldn’t end Liverpool’s unbeaten league run at Anfield.

United went into the game a point clear of second-placed Leicester after their win over Southampton on Saturday night and this draw means they are unbeaten in 12 league games since their defeat by Arsenal, picking up 30 points from a possible 36.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made three changes from the team that won doggedly at Burnley last week, with Victor Lindelof, Fred and Scott McTominay coming in for Eric Bailly, Edinson Cavani and Nemanja Matic.

Liverpool controlled the opening 20 minutes of the game but United looked the most likely team to score beyond that period, with Bruno Fernandes going close from a free-kick.
