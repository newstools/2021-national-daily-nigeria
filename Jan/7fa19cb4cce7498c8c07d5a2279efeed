He stated this on his Twitter handle this morning. Read his tweet below
“Lagosians, #COVID19 is not a glamorous disease, neither is it a hoax. You need to follow the safety guidelines to safeguard your friends and loved ones. In the midst of increasing #COVID19 cases, we have some good news from our Infectious Diseases Hospital.
We have activated a new oxygen plant which will help by providing much needed oxygen to patients. The plant will supplement oxygen supply to about 300 cylinders per day and 6 cylinders per hour.
We are working to ensure patients receive the best care at our state facilities — Babajide Sanwo-Olu (@jidesanwoolu) January 10, 2021
