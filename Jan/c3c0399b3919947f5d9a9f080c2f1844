In a bid to take over a community from a rival warlord, a band of militants descended on Bayelsa community in no fewer than 50 boats, razing houses and dispersing the villagers.
The invaded community, Peremabiri, is in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa, and Paul Eris, also known as Ogunbos, is the militant leader targeted.
According to report, the gunmen came in over 50 speedboats, shooting as they entered the community which they have occupied now since Sunday.
The attack on Ogunbosâ€™ house was also planned to drive him out of the town so they could take total control of the community.
There has been no official statement form the security agencies in the state.
