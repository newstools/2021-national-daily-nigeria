The Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has attacked Dele Momodu for describing her principal as a failure.
Recall that Momodu, Publisher of Ovation Magazine, had on Friday via his Twitter handle -@DeleMomodu, said, “I did not bring Buhari. I did what most reasonable Democrats would have done in the circumstance of PDP’s failure after 16 years in power by trying the next most electable candidate and when he failed tried the next…”
Onochie, who was nominated by President Buhari for confirmation by the Senate as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), representing Delta State few months back, replied Momodu on her Twitter handle -@Laurester: “‘Failed’ because he (Buhari) won’t dish out cash for photos that can easily be obtained on Instagram and other picture apps.”
She added, “Because #BabaNoDeyDrop, your ego-massaging, ostentatious and filthy-wealth-flaunting customers, can no longer afford you (Momodu). Try Diversification!”
