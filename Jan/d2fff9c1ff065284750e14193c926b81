President Muhammadu Buhari has sacked the nation’s security service chiefs as Nigerians groan under the burden of killings, kidnapping, and terrorism.
He immediately appointed new ones to take over.
According to Femi Adesina, special adviser on media and publicity to Buhari, in a tweet on Tuesday:
“PMB appoints new Service Chiefs. Maj Gen LEO Irabor, CDS (Chief of Defence Staff), Maj Gen I Attahiru, Army, Rear Adm AZ Gambo, Navy, AVM IO Amao, Air Force.
“He congratulates outgoing Service Chiefs on efforts to bring enduring peace to the country.”
The outgoing service chiefs include General Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin (Chief of Defence Staff); Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai (Chief of Army Staff); Vice Admiral Ibok Ibas (Chief of Naval Staff); and Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar (Chief of Air Staff).
Most of these former chiefs had their service extended by Buhari, who fond it hard to release them until the public outcry for new broom became unbearable.
