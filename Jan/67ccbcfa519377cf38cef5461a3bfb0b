As Oyo Gov Seyi Makinde ordered the police to treat as common criminals the Igangan Â agitators that sacked a Fulani community on Friday, the IGP Ibrahim too has given CP Ngozi Onadeko a phone order to arrest and bundle Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, to Abuja.
Presidential Media Assistant Garba Shehu, confirmed this in an interview with BBC Hausa.
Igboho ordered herdsmen in Ibarapa Local Government Area of Oyo State to leave within seven days, for their alleged involvement in banditry and killings in the area to them.
The ultimatum apparently led to the Friday violence in which the house of the Serikin Fulani of Oyo was razed and 11 cars burnt as the Fulani leader and his family fled for Ogun.
Igboho, an ethnic agitator, is just hitting the limelight as insecurity attributed to Fulani herders escalates in Oyo.
