A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Kingsley Moghalu, has expressed concerns over the reported arrest of Omoyele Sowore, an activist and former presidential candidate in 2019 general elections.
Omoyele Sowore was arrested by the Nigerian Police on Friday morning for leading another protest in Abuja.
Moghalu, also a former presidential candidate, expressed disgust over the arrest, noting that the activist was arrested for no reason, and therefore should be released by the authority.
“I am deeply concerned about the reported arrest of @YeleSowore, for no apparent reason other than engaging in a public protest that is his right as a Nigerian citizen.
Moghalu while demanding the release of the activist noted that Sowore is an active citizen. He said the government should not squash voices of dissent.
“Sowore is an active citizen, and Nigeria should not squash voices of dissent. I strongly demand his release.
