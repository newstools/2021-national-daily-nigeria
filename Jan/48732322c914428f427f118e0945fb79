A 33-year-old hottie has outed on social media about his broken relationship with the world’s richest black man AlikeDangote, owner of the Dangote Group.
Lewis, as she identified herself, hails from Liberty City which is in the US, and runs a real estate business and restaurant in Georgia.
“I dated the richest black man in the world. He broke my heart in 1000 pieces,” the lady wrote in an INSTAGRAM post Dec 31.
“Communicating with a billionaire daily makes you see the world differently than your humble beginnings in liberty city. I became more organized and finally am able to step away from the daily kitchen operations. I realized a half a million-dollar restaurant project was a bad investment. I purchased two properties. I started a consistent fitness regime. Became vegan. Obtained a profitable stock portfolio. He changed my perspective on work ethic and patience. Once my mindset changed the universe gravitated me to people that uplifted me and increased my net worth mentally and financially. To 2021 and powerful encounters.
But she said se learnt a thing or two also.
“I learned to love without strings. Give your best without expectations. Nothing is forever,” she added.
Her post has been trending as Dangote and his media handler keep mum.
Reactions have been pouring in. Some see through her and her mischief, wondering what manner of a broken heart revels in the sweet memory of a love affair cut short.
Others also wonder the super-rich Nigerian horses around, too.
Little is known about the industrialist love life–except that he’s been in an out of a number of marriages.
