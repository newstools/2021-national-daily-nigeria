The criminal suit an activist filed against no fewer than 50 allegedly leaders of the Octobe ENDSARS protest across the nation in an Abuja magistrate court has been suspended by a high court sitting in Abuja Wdnesday.
The court also restrained the Nigeria Police Force from arresting or taking any action against the #EndSARS activists.
The complainant, Kenechukwu Okeke, filed the suit against the activists for their roles in the protests at Wuse Zone 6 Magistratesâ€™ Court, Abuja before a Chief Magistrate II, Omolola Tolulope Akindele.
He alleged that during the protest, his belongings were destroyed and that the defendants who promoted the #EndSARS protests must be brought to justice.
But the court order followed a suit by Samuel Ihensekhien Junior on behalf of Adeyanju and 49 others.
Among the defendants are Sam Adeyemi, senior pastor of Daystar Christian Centre; Kanu Nwankwo, former Nigerian international footballer; Innocent Idibia, Nigerian singer and songwriter popularly known as 2face; Adeleke, Nigerian Afropop singer, better known as Davido.
Others listed in the suit include Aisha Yesufu, Kiki Mordi, Peter Okoye, Paul Okoye, Deji Adeyanju, Tiwa Savage, Folarin Falana (Falz), Feyikemi Abudu, and Debo Adebayo.
The anti-police brutality protests lasted for 12 days, climaxing in a nation-wide meltdown of law and order.
And the fallout also include scrapping of the SARS unit of the police, setting up of judicial panels to look into cases of police brutality.
