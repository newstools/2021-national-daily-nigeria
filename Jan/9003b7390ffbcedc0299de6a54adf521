A body, Pan Nigeria Presidency of Igbo Extraction Coalition, PANPIEC, has advised former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to forget their 2023 presidential elections.
The group’s Director of Planning and Strategy, Chief Pat Anyanwu, disclosed this on Saturday, after a meeting between the Coalition and a northern group, Arewa Power Shift Movement, in Port Harcourt Rivers State.
Chief Pat Anyanwu noted that power shifting to Igbo land in 2023 will end the wounds of the civil war, calling on all Nigerians to support the realisation of Nigeria Presidential project in 2023.
He said there are many qualified Igbos to take up the calling and Nigerians should choose among them.
On his part, the leader of the delegation, Mallam Dahiru Imam, noted that the North has a sense of justice and will support Ndigbo in 2023.
He however called on Ndigbo to put their acts together, regretting the cacophony in Ohanaeze Ndigbo after their election in Owerri.
The Arewa leader wondered why Ohanaeze election would generate the level of discord it did and noted that such outcome is worrying to other Nigerians especially with the agitation for Ndigbo to produce the next Nigeria President.
He also asked Ndigbo to look into the agitation for Biafra which also frightens the rest of Nigeria.
