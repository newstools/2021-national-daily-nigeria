Rights activist and publisher of Sahara Reporters Omoyele Sowore has begun a hunger strike following his inability to have access to his books in detention.
Sowore and others were arrested and brutalized Dec 31 while rounding off their crossover protest in Abuja.
While in detention, Sowore’s asked his brother to bring him his books to refresh his mind but the police didn’t allow that—except a change of clothes and food.
The activist however protested.
“I cannot feed my stomach when I haven’t fed my brain,” he said while rejecting food.
Hs co-detainees have joined the hunger strike.
Sowore has been going in and out of detention since August 2019 when he planned a nationwide protest tagged Revolution Now.
He contested the 2019 presidential election, and lost.
