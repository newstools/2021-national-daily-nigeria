The Bayero University of Kano (BUK) has become the first university in Nigeria to have cancelled a whole session.
The Senate of Bayero of the varsity approved the cancelation of 2019-2020 sessions for all Undergraduate and Postgraduate programs in the school.
The cancellation was contained in a memo signed by the university registrar, Fatima Binta-Mohammed.
According to a memo Jan 4, for undergraduates, new academic session will now begin on January 18, 2021 as first semester, while the second semester will begin May 3, 2021.
For the postgraduates, the senate slated January 18 as first semester, while the second semester will begin on June 1.
Postgraduate students who did not register within the time frame to do so before the session begins are equally given some grace.
Although the BUK had already completed its mid-semester break for first semester of 2019/2020 academic session for undergraduates, while the postgraduate students had just resumed for the session, the nine-moth-long strike and covid-19 lockdown disrupted the session.
