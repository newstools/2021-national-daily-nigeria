Ondo Gov Rotimi has become the first southwester governor to take a most drastic step in responding to the atrocities of Fulani herders—and his decision is not in favour of the nomads.
He has given a seven-day ultimatum to all the herders to leave the Forest Reserves in the state.
The APC governor further added that no herd should be moved about in the cities, and none should graze by night.
Akeredolu’s hard tackle may surprise Nigerians who believe the Fulani herders are untouchable because teir grand patron, President Muhammadu Buhari, is Fulani, and will always protect his tribesmen interest.
“We have taken major steps at addressing the root cause of kidnapping, in particular, and other nefarious activities detailed and documented in security reports, the press and debriefings from victims of kidnap cases in Ondo State,” the governor said.
According to him, the incidents are traceable to the activities of some bad elements masquerading as herdsmen who have turned forest reserves into hideouts for keeping victims of kidnapping, negotiating for ransoms and carrying out other criminal activities.
“As the Chief Law and Security Officer of the State, it is my constitutional obligation to do everything lawful to protect the lives and property of all residents of the state,” he said.
Kidnapping for ransom, and murder have been o the uptick in the state.
Traditional rulers, businessmen, farmers have fllen prey to to the criminals suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.
The Western Security Network, Amotekun, launched last year for the purpose of curbing the criminalities across the southwest hasn’t done much.
