As confrontation continues between the federal government and Ondo Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu, citizens of the state have sided with their governor in evicting Fulani herders from the state’s forest reserves.
Farmers, forest guards and the members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Ondo State staged a protest Thursday against the incessant abduction of their members allegedly by some gunmen suspected to be herdsmen.
The protesters insisted the order was made in the interest of the security of lives and properties of the people of the state.
The governor ordered the Fulani herders in the forest to leave, and stop night grazing, including in the cities.
A couple of SANs, like Ebun Adegboruwa, Yussuf Ali have agreed and others like Mike Ozekhome have disagreed with the governors order.
Carrying placards with various inscriptions, the protesters said if the insecurity in Ondo was not quickly checked, it might lead to chaos and famine.
