Petroleum dealers and marketers under the aegis of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) have shut down all filling stations in Ibarapa region of Oyo State following the killing of the owner of Subawah petroleum, Mrs. Sherifat Adisa by unknown gunmen.
The Ibadan depot of the association has also threatened to shut down all filling stations in the state if the situation did not improve.
The chairman, Ibadan Depot, Mrs Bukola Mutiu, in a statement issued said the closure of all filling stations in Ibarapa area of the state is a warning to the Oyo State government to urgently arrest the growing trend of killings and kidnap of petroleum dealers in the state.
Describing the killing of Mrs. Sherifat Adisa as one too many, IPMAN warned that except the trend, all filling stations in the state would be shut down.
Bukola said, “This killing and kidnapping has become so rampant as a series of cases have been coming up recently.
“Last Saturday, one of us, Alhaja Sherifat Adisa, who was the owner of Subawah petroleum, was kidnapped at about 7:30 p.m. from her office and two people were also killed in her station. Her corpse was found at about 11:00 p.m. close to her station.
“However, IPMAN has decided to close down all petrol stations in Ibarapa till something is done by the government to protect them and if something is not done, the shutdown of all petrol stations will be extended to Oyo State as a whole.”
