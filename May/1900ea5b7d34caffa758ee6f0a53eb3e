The Islamic State of West Africa appears to have taken control of government in the Geidam LGA of Yobe.
The terrorist occupation of the area followed the recent spate of attacks it mounted against the security agencies stationed in the area.
The terrorist organization now parades different models of armoured tanks and operational vehicles it captured from the military.
Beyond that, members of the group are said to be distributing tracts proclaiming its establishment of a caliphate, and death to Christians and enemies of the group.
“Our major aim: to uplift the word of Allah, protect the religion of Islam and the wealth of the followers,’ the publication stated.
“Our target: those who do not believe in our ideology, Christians and even Muslims who do not believe in our teachings.
“Any Muslim who is not supporting the empire of Islam is our target.
“Anyone who comes to us for forgiveness, and stop fighting us will be exempted from attacks.”
The group also said it has handed out N20,000 to some households.
Yobe has been one of the three states the Islamic insurgency has hit the hardest for over 10 years by Boko Haram initially, and then its offshoot ISWAP now.
