The pressure on Gulak’s wife to request for the phone conversation records came at a time the Nigeria Police, especially, the Imo State Police Command, has been rolling out reports of activities on the killers of the former presidential aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan. The police had disclosed engaging the perpetrators in a gun battle, injuring some of the killers.
Those putting pressure on Gulak’s wife, argued that records of the phone conversation would reveal the killers of her husband or at best provide clue to those that might be involved in the assassination.
“The wife of Gulak should ask for the phone records of her husband and she will see who killed her husband…,” one of the sources of pressure on Gulak’s wife had declared.
