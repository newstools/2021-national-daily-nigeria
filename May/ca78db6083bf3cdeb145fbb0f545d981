The Inspector General of Police, Acting IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has assured of public safety in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Plateau State and other contiguous States. The IG assuring citizens of safety and security, encouraged them to go about their lawful day-to-day activities.
The Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja,CP Frank Mba, in a statement explained that IGP’s assurance is coming on the heels of the unintended, viral spread of an internal directive issued to the Commissioners of Police in Plateau State and FCT Commands to forestall any likelihood of attack or breach of security by organized criminal elements in their Areas of Responsibilities (AOR).
“The IGP’s directive, which is a deliberate, intelligence-driven and proactive measure, is designed to prepare the law enforcement community for comprehensive response to any threat to lives and property.
“The IGP noted that the security alert, rather than becoming a source of panic to the citizens, should instead send a message of re-assurance to them about the intelligence depth, capacity and operational preparedness of the Nigeria Police to preemptively deal and contain any threat to public peace and security.
“The alert does not in any way suggest that an attack is imminent in any of the two States,” CP Mba highlighted.
The Police High Command, therefore, called for calm, urging citizens to go about their normal activities with renewed sense of vigour, patriotism, and vigilance, reassuring that the Police will continue to work with other relevant stakeholders to keep the public space safe.
