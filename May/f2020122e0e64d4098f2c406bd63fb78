Away fans will be barred from attending the final two rounds of English Premier League (EPL) games this season, the league organisers announced on Wednesday.
Up to 10,000 fans will be allowed into matches in round 37 on May 18 and May 19 and in round 38 on May 23.
But this is if the Government goes ahead with the planned easing of coronavirus restrictions on May 17.
However, a decision has now been taken to limit this to home spectators.
“Following consultation with clubs, it was agreed matches would not be open to away supporters.
“This is due to varying operational challenges across the league and the need to deliver a consistent approach, while maximising the opportunity for home-fan attendance,” a league statement read.
“The safety and security of supporters is of paramount importance.
“Clubs have a proven track record of providing Covid-safe environments and have operational plans in place ready to safely welcome supporters back to their stadiums.”
The Government is set to announce whether or not restrictions will be eased no later than Monday.
