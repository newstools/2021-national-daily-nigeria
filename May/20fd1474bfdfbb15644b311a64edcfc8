The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar III on Tuesday, express his worries over lack of transparency in administering recovered loot in Nigeria.
“The government owes Nigerians an explanation, we want to know how much billions of naira was recovered from our past leaders. Where the monies are and what are they doing with them?” he said.
The sultan delivered a speech through his representative Prof Sambo Wali at an ICPC zonal stakeholders’ dialogue in Sokoto on Tuesday.
Considering how ineffective the nation’s ethic and integrity codes are, the highest spiritual leader of Islam in Nigeria advocates for a switch to Islamic codes.
According to him, the founders of the Sokoto Caliphate had written many books on corruption and how it could be addressed using Islamic ways.
The Sultan urged Nigerian leaders to obtain copies of those books in order to be guided in getting to tackling corruption.
The ICPC was founded  on a secular act of the federation (by the National Assembly) that guides its operations and processes.
