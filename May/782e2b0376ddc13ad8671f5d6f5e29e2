Share this on WhatsAppThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has been gripped with panic over preconceived crisis that would tear the party to pieces after the primaries in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
The National Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, in a proactive action, appointed a Reconciliation Committee headed by Governor Yahaya Bello of Kofi State in view of the processes of nomination of APC candidates for the forthcoming Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Council Elections.
The Committee comprises of Governor Yahaya Bello – chairman; Akinremi Olaide- secretary; Governor Abdullah Sule – member; Senator Ahmed Yusuf Yusuf – member; Cletus Dick-member;
Uche Ogah – member; and Dr. James Lalu- member.
the mandate of the Committee is to: Identify persons who may have taken issues with the conduct of the exercise(s), the issues in contention (if any) and take practical steps to conciliate and harmonize all such persons and issues in time for a satisfactory outcome in the FCT Area Council Elections.
However, neither the national leadership of the APC nor the reconciliation committee have any reference point of ensuring that the nomination processes are transparent and fair to all stakeholders.
