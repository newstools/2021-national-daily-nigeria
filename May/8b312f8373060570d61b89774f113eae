A statement by presidential aide, Laolu Akande, said the solicitation by the group is trending on WhatsApp with a suggestion that the Vice President has “quietly” declared intention to run.
Akande said the VP is not in any way connected to this website or the group behind it and considers such an enterprise an unnecessary distraction.
“Prof. Osinbajo has not declared any interest whatsoever in the 2023 election”, the spokesman noted.
