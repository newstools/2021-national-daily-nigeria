The NASS budget has been in the range of N120 billion and above annually, and Nigerians are worried the money is not well spent.
Ndume, in his renewed zeal, however urged the government to source funds for security same way it does to fund infrastructure and other developmental projects in Nigeria.
“The President should make the issue of security a priority. He should leave every other thing and concentrate on security,” he said while briefing journalists in Abuja May 12.
“That means even if they will stop paying us and use the money to tackle security. Is it not when you are secured that you talk of other things? It is not only the politicians but everybody.
“If you know that you cannot move out of your house and they say sacrifice your salary, won’t you do it? Many people are working from home, yet they are being paid.
“They should stop paying salaries and address the whole issue of insecurity. If you don’t have money, stop paying salaries and allowances and use the money to provide security.
“If you are borrowing money to provide infrastructure, why can’t we borrow money to protect our people.”
More than 2000 have died since the insecurity problem escalated, according to a coalition of CSOs.
