Fresh tension engulfs the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, over the advancement of bandits into the territory targeting to strike at certain locations. The emerging fear culminated into the closure of the Nigerian Law School and Veritas University in Bwari by the management of the institutions.
The management was said to have received a threat letter from bandits of their plot to strike and kidnap students of the institutions.
Accordingly, several students of the two schools were compelled to go home fir their safety after the impromptu closure of the institutions in Bwari, Bwari Area Council.
The apprehension had become germane since Bwari is on the outskirts of Abuja on the route to Madalla, Suleja, down to Minna in Niger State where bandits have held sway, capturing several rural communities, hoisting Islamic State flag. A Catholic Church at Madalla in Niger State, adjacent to Zuba in the FCT, was a target of bomb explosion in the early days of Boko Haram terrorists  upsurge and attack on the FCT.
The satellite town is also on the way to Kaduna from the heart of the FCT, where there have been high activities of bandits.
The satellite towns on the outskirts of the FCT towards Kaduna and Niger states, which include Zuba, Madalla, and others, have been vulnerable overtime to attacks by bandits and Boko Haram.
The emerging fear has a tendency to increase the risk of school children in lower institutions.
