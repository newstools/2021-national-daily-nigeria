But May 18, an offshoot of the terrorist group, ISWAP, in years-long bitter rivalry, over-ran Shekau’s domain in the Sambisa, and he took his own life, for the shame of being captured alive.
ISWAP leader Bana Duguri led his group in the clash that threw Boko Haram into disarray during the week.
Perhaps the US authorities felt morally compelled to follow up on their promise of rewards. So in a tweet, the State Department Rewards for Justice Program indicated Duguri—or ISWAP claim take the bounty.
“News reports today indicate that Boko Haram terrorist Abubakar Shekau blew himself up in a confrontation with ISIS affiliates.
“Hey, ISIS guys. To clarify: no – you are not eligible for the reward for information on his identity or location. That’s not how the program works.”
The Nigerian military says it is still investigating the reports about Shekau death.
While some claimed he blew himself up but survived, and in critical conditions, others said he was dead.
