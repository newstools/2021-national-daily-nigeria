The State of Ohio in the US is adopting different approaches to ensure greater population of the state received coronavirus vaccine, particularly, the youths.
More states and businesses were said to have been identified to be luring people with incentives to change their minds in accepting the coronavirus vaccine in order to counter “vaccine hesitancy.”
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine last week declared that the Government of Ohio will give $1 million each to five people, in addition to another five people as four-year college scholarships in a lottery scheme so as lure young Ohioans to get the COVID vaccine.
Some Ohio lawmakers were said to have opposed the governor’s approach, arguing that there are better ways to spend the state’s COVID relief funds. The approach was also said to be questioned by Ohio Attorney General, Dave Yost, who noted that he is not sure the plan is legal. He argued that even if it is legal, “just because a thing may be legally done does not mean it should be done.”
