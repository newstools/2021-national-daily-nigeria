Share this on WhatsAppThe All Progressives Congress (APC) has appointed former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State, Deputy Chairman of the South West subcommittee of the Contact and Strategy Committee.
Former Governor Ambode in a tweet on his twitter handle on Tuesday, disclosed the appointment, explaining that the decision will help to deepen and consolidate the gains of the party in the South West and prepare it as a strong and viable institution for both the present and foreseeable future.
Ambode had tweeted: “I was recently appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the South West subcommittee of the Contact and Strategy Committee of our great party (APC), to help deepen and consolidate the gains of the party in the South West, prepare it as a strong and viable institution for both the present and foreseeable future.”
Earlier on March 23, Ambode was appointed a member of the Committee by the National Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.
Ambode had met with the Chairman of the Contact and Strategy Committee, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State.
Former Governor Ambode has been experiencing rising profile, after the frustration for getting the APC governorship ticket in Lagos State for a second tenure, under the Caretaker Committee of the party. He had gone under since the 2019 general elections but remained calm and focus.
