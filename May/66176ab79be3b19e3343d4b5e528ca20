The victim, who was a coordinator of Anuagata Development Centre in Ohaozara Local Government, was kidnapped and tortured last Thursday by suspected political thugs. He was freed the next day.
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) urged the Inspector General of Police Usman Alkali to probe the abduction.
It said it did not trust the Commissioner of Police to be impartial.
Ebonyi PDP spokesman Silas Onu said in a statement: “We are calling on the IGP, even as our leaders take necessary steps in that direction, to personally open an investigation into this high crime. Immunity does not last forever.”
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been accusing each other of masterminding the kidnap and torture.
Umahi, who condemned the kidnap, ordered investigation into the incident.
He said this in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze.
The statement said: “Having followed the trend of events, including accusations and counter-accusations in some quarters, The Governor of Ebonyi State, David Nweze Umahi, condemns the unsavoury situation in strong terms, knowing that such is unhealthy for collective democratic existence.
“The governor has directed the police and other security agencies to swing into action by unearthing all perpetrators of the dastardly act, to enable them face justice. He wishes Mr. Ogbonna a quick recovery.”
