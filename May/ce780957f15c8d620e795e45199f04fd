A truckload of ammunition nearly sailed through to its destination somewhere in the southeast but for happenstance on Sunday.
The truck, a Mercedes Benz 911, lost control on its way out of Onitsha, jackknifed, and the container slipped down, hitting the Awka road, and emptying some of its contents: cartons of live bullets.
It was first witnessed by early church goers who alerted security agencies that came to seal off the scene.
The truck driver was arrested by the police, but his conductor escaped.
The two actually stretched their luck too thin. Reports said they were trying to clean up and hide the illegal cargo when the accident happened 5 am—until the time police swooped in on them.
In 2018, a truck carrying 200,000 live bullets to Onitsha from Benin Republic was intercepted by the Nigeria Customs Service around Niger.
The police have yet to give any official statement on the Sunday incident.
Anambra, Imo, Abia, and Ebonyi have been in the heat of killing and arson by “unknown gunmen” many believe are members of the secessionist group IPOB troubling in the region.
