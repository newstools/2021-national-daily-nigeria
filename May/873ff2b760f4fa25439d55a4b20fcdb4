Former President Goodluck Jonathan is worried how the most powerful clique in Nigeria, the Nigerian Governors Forum, goes about resolving national issues.
According to him, the 36 state governors run the country.
“The President is just one person in Abuja,” he said during a thanksgiving serve at Rock of Ages Christian Assembly International, Benin, on Sunday.
“I don’t love a situation where the Northern governors will meet, then the Southern governors will cry foul and vice versa,’ ’he said
“This will not help our country.”
Since the 17 southern governors met in Asaba, Delta, last week, there have been a lot of blowback against the consensus the governors had: a ban of open grazing and a national dialogue.
Leaders of thoughts in the north have criticized the ban, alleging it will lead to disintegration of the country.
The only northern governor who commented on the decision so far was in agreement.
Kano Gov. Umar Ganduje urged the Fulani herders to relocate if they can’t do without open grazing.
The former president urged the governors to unite.
“If there are issues affecting one or two states, I think the governors should see how they can collectively come with a way to address those issues,” he added.
