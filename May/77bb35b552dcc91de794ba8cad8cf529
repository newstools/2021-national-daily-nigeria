An advocacy group, the Niger Delta Conscience Coalition, has called for citizens’ support towards the conclusion of the forensic audit on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).
The group made the call in a statement by its Chairman, Aniefiok Obot and Secretary, John Adangu-Jumbo, in Uyo on Wednesday.
The group expressed worries over the criticism that trailed the July terminal date for the ongoing forensic audit of the NDDC.
It said that those, who resorted to blackmail against the terminal date, were against the progress of the region.
“It is wrong not to recognise the promises that the forensic audit holds for the economic and social emancipation of the Niger Delta region.
“By resorting to spurious blackmail against its duration, this set of critics have shown themselves as enemies of the region’s progress,” the group said.
It commended President Mohammadu Buhari-led government for insisting on the logical conclusion of the audit, saying, “Let us support the process, it is to our advantage.
“It is in the interest of the region to have an acceptable document on the outcome of the audit; this will enable the region to arrive at a position capable of driving its development.
“The irreducible minimum expected from the exercise is that the curiosity of the people to unravel the alleged financial recklessness in the commission will be satisfied.”
