The two most volatile states in the northeast Nigeria being ravaged by the Boko Haram terrorists, Borno and Yobe, have expressed vehement opposition to establishment of state police or creation of more states in the country. Both northeast states in their separate presentations at the public hearing on the amendment of the 1999 constitution in Bauchi, also rejected the creation of more local governments.
Speaker of the Borno State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Abdulkareem Lawan, stated that Borno State does not require state police, noting that the state already has the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF). The speaker apparently was opposing duplication of structures and not really the imperatives of alternative force to the Nigeria Police or Army.
The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Yobe State, Saleh Samanja, also disclosed that the state government had rejected the establishment of state police.
They argued that the state police can be compromised and abuse for political purpose and create worse situation than the problem they intend to solve.
Samanja had argued: “The state police can be abused for political reasons and create more insecurity.
“Rather, measures should be put in place to encourage community policing under strict supervision.”
 
However, Bauchi State disagreed with Borno and Yobe states.
Secretary to the Bauchi State Government, Sabiu Baba, stated that Bauchi State supports the establishment of state police to reduce the over-dependence of the state governors on federal law enforcement agencies.
The SSG also aligned with the demands for more local governments, saying that most states which have lower population and landmass than Bauchi has more local government councils.
Baba, therefore, declared that Bauchi State supports the creation of a state and more local governments from the present Bauchi.
