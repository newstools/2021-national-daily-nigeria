Amidst the uproar for the removal of Isa Pantami, minister of communication and digital economy, alleged to be sympathetic to extremist views, President Muhammadu Buhari has found reason to celebrate him.
But the commendation is about the 49-year-old’s achievement as a minister.
“I commend the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami), for the landmark achievements of the digital economy sector and his commitment in carrying out his responsibility of developing the  sector, including championing the growth of the indigenous telecom sector and NIN-SIM registration process.
Buhari gave the commendation at the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector and the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration on Thursday.
The SIM card registration policy has been the major ground on which many Nigerians are launching attacks at Pantami.
They believe his Jihadist disposition and privacy database he oversees are combination that can endanger national security.
Aso Rock had earlier defended him, stating those unhappy with Pantami’s policies are behind the campaign against him.
The minister himself admitted he held those views when he was young, adding he has since changed a lot of views and position of Islam.
But some Nigerians doubt he has changed.
