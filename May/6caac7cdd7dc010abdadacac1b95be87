Atlas Mara has been working with Rothschild & Company to consider options for its Union Bank stake, Bloomberg News has reported.
Bloomberg also noted that if a deal is reached it could bring down the curtain on Atlas Mara’s African foray after Diamond, a former Barclays CEO, misjudged competition on the continent and overpaid for acquisitions.
On Wednesday Atlas Mara announced that it has secured regulatory approval for the sales of its businesses in Botswana and Mozambique and received interest in other assets.
The statement also noted that the company has completed a planned restructuring process, and extended a standstill agreement with its creditors to May 17 to complete necessary documentation.
