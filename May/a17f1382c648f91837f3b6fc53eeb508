A pro-democracy group, APC Ambassadors of Nigeria, has endorsed former governor of Benue, Sen. George Akume, for the position of National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
A statement issued on Monday in Abuja by the National Coordinator of the group, Dr Aliyu Ibrahim, described Akume as a politician with the pedigree to reposition the party.
According to him, this unfolding development is coming ahead of the 2023 Presidential and general elections in which roadmaps are already being laid by party members who understand the dynamics of power-game, power-play and balance of power.
“For the APC, sustaining her hold on the political leadership power of government at the three-tiers of governance is the uppermost concern, facing all thought-processes or considerations in the present power equation moves.
“One political leadership figure who understands and applies the principles and laws of political power and deploys the same to good advantage under national group and social dynamics across population sizes, patterns and distributions, is Sen. George Akume.
“Ibrahim said that having a strong political personality as Sen. Akume would be a positive gain for the party, given his robust intellectual and administrative experiences.
“His competence, discipline, rich capacity for tolerance and humility in relating with people irrespective of class, race or religion places Akume as the best candidate to lead the APC,’’ Ibrahim said.
Akume, a two-time civilian governor of Benue is currently Nigeria’s Minister of Special Duties & Inter-Governmental Relations.
