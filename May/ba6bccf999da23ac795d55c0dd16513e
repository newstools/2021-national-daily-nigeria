“You can’t solve a problem unless you know the causative,” said Imo ex-governor and Sen. Rochas Okorocha.
This jibes with what many of Buhari’s critics have been saying—that the president is not in control and unaware of the killing and looming anarchy in Nigeria.
According to Okorocha, the cause of Nigerian problem lies in injustice and poverty.
The he pointed out the slow response of the government on occasion it responds.
For instance, it takes close to two months before dozens of students bandits kidnapped in Nigeria were rescued.
“And the quicker government moves to address the issue of injustice, the better it is for our nation to reduce the level of anger on the nation,” the senator said.
He however urged Nigeria to look on the brighter side.
Okorocha fell out with Aso Rock when it became difficult for him to impose his son-in-law as APC guber candidate in Imo.
The EFCC has been dealing with corruption allegation against him with an intensity no one can dispute as having a nod from Aso Rock.
So it is easy to understand why he now hits the president he supported for a second term.
