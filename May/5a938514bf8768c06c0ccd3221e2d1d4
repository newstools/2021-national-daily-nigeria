And the governor could only watch his quarry on whom he earlier placed a bounty.
“Let the governor come and arrest me,” Wabba  as he led thousands of workers for a peaceful protest in the state capital.
“The strike was not about me. Let him come and arrest me. We are here and waiting for them.”
The strike grounded Kaduna state to a halt on day one of the protest, and El-Rufai couldn’t bear it.
In a tweet, he listed economic activities the strike has paralysed, and he accused Wabba of sabotage.
He declared the unionists wanted, ad offered a generous reward for anyone that found Wabba.
The workers are protesting a mass sack the governor has embarked on.
