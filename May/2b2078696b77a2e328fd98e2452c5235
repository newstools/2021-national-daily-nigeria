Sadly for the Red Devils, the centre-half who doubles as their captain was forced to limp off in United Sunday’s win over Aston Villa at Villa Park and he is now facing a race against time to make it to Gdnask for the Europa League showdown on May 26.
Sequel to above, National Daily can confirm from the report by The Sun that the 28-year-old defender is set to miss Manchester United’s final four league games as he aims to be fit for the Europa League final.
The Red Devils are slated to take on Villarreal as they eye a first trophy in four years, but could painfully be without their captain.
Maguire and United are anxiously awaiting the results of a scan after suffering an ankle injury on Sunday National Daily gathered.
Obviously, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be eager to have his skipper and defensive cornerstone fit by the end of the month.
The United boss meanwhile did not appear confident that the former Leicester City defender would be available for the Gdnask showpiece when he spoke immediately after Maguire hobbled off at Villa Park on Sunday.
“Hopefully [the Europa League final] will be OK with Harry. I don’t know,” he said.
“We need to check it. It might be a few weeks or a month – we don’t know. It was his ankle or lower leg. I think the player landed on him and he twisted something.”
United will trade tackle with Maguire’s former club Leicester City on Tuesday before hosting Liverpool on Thursday in their rescheduled fixture.
Maguire is also likely to miss United’s games against Fulham and Wolves on May 18th and 23rd respectively.
