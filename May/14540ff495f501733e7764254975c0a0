According to a report by Sahara Reporters, Buhari had earlier planned to attend Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni inauguration, and then make a crow fly from there to the UK.
As that didn’t jell out, Buhari had to send V.P Yemi Osinbajo to Uganda.
Quoting top presidency sources, the online news portal said Buhari’s health, particularly his dementia, had deteriorated lately.
“He was incoherent during the recent meetings he had with security chiefs and the Head of the European Union delegation to Nigeria and to the Economic Community of West African States, Mr Ketil Karlsen, along with his team,” the report stated.
Buhari recently came back from medical vacation in London where he was heckled for days by Nigerians in the UK.
His health, since 2016, has been a major drag o the administration, and any believe he has been so incapacitated he has no idea what’s going on the country.
Worse is his refusal to hand over to Osinbajo when the president travels out nowadays, thereby drawing more criticism from Nigerians.
