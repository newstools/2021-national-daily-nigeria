A stakeholder meeting by the APC May 8 brought together the party’s two former national chairmen who fell apart years ago and torn the party’s NEC into shreds.
Adams Oshiomhole and John Odigie-Oyegun were among the party leaders that attended the meeting convened by the Edo APC caretaker committee in Benin.
There Oyegun stated emphatically, “I belong to APC body and soul’, urging “Let us put the past behind, and let us look at the future.”
And Oshiomhole, too, in his remarks, called on the party members in Edo to close ranks and work harmoniously with the leadership of the party in the state and other levels in the overall interest of the party.
The two former governors became enemies when Oyegun had to abort his second-term plan as the party’s national chairman, and, with the help of APC national leader Bola Tinubu, Oshiomhole got elected.
Tinubu was also instrumental to Oyegun’s first tenure, though.
The bad blood that change of leadership created spread across the states, and Oshiomhole was eventually frozen out of the party with the help of President Muhammadu Buhari.
But all that is history now, the ex-chairmen said.
The chairman of the caretaker committee, Daid Imusen, praised all the members in Edo State for the success of the just-concluded membership registration.
“Right now, APC has a very credible and reliable data base of its members in every unit across the entire country,” he said.
“Our party is now a stronger and more united party as a result of the exceptional membership registration.”
