Ayade’s CPS, Christian Ita confirmed the defection May 20.
Ita said the governor made his defection known in a meeting with six APC governors who visited him at the Government House.
The National Daily earlier reort how a team led by Sokoto Gov Aminu Tambuwal and his Delta and Enugu counterpart had a meeting with the governor when it first occurred to the party Ayade was about to hop out.
Cross River has witnessed a war of attrition between the governor and a faction peopled by the state’s federal lawmakers who would not recognize his party leadership.
With Ayade move, the ruling APC now has three PDP governors that walked in to the APC.
