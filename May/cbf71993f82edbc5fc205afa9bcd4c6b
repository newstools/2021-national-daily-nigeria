Less than 24 hours after the ultimatum kidnappers gave the Kaduna government to pay N100 million and supply motorcycles—or else the remaining 27 victims would be killed— efforts to secret their release eventually jelled out.
According to the Daily Trust, Sheikh Abu Gumi, with support of former President Olusegu Obasanjo, worked out the release.
Gumi had been urging the federal government to intervene by asking the CBN to release the fund since Kaduna Gov. Nasir El Rufai insisted he would pay no ransom.
The students were part of the 37 abducted by the bandits are students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State.
One of the persons who received the students said the release was facilitated by the Sheikh Ahmad Gumi dialogue committee with support from Obasanjo.
After payment of ransom by parents and school management, the bandits only released 10 of the victims.
Although the abductors backed down from their initial demand of N500m—to N100m—there is no information yet on how much the parents and school authorities paid.
A parent, however, said they contributed N800,000 which was channeled through the Gumi negotiating committee.
The Islamic scholar has been intervening in securing the release of kidnap victims across the north, preaching change of heart to the criminals in the process.
Although some other scholars say paying ransom is not acceptable, persuading the victims ad government to choose death over being ransomed.
