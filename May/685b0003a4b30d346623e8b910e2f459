Mrs Lami Ga’anda, the Adamawa Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, has tasked parents on the observance of COVID-19 protocols and proper upbringing of their children.
Ga’anda made the call at a children’s party organised as part of activities to mark the 2021 Children’s Day celebration in Yola, on Thursday.
She described the theme for this year’s celebration: “Effects of COVID-19 on total wellbeing of the Nigerian Child: Way Forward”, as timely and underscoring the need for all to continue observing the protocols.
“The theme is chosen in consideration of the current global realities of the COVID-19, as it affects the wellbeing and safety of our children and with a view of overcoming the challenges of the pandemic,” she said.
The commissioner commended Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri for his support to children in the state to join their colleagues in other states of the federation in celebrating the day.
In her remarks, Mrs Lami Fintiri, wife of the Governor, expressed her love for the children and urged them to always behave well at all-time to succeed in future.
The first lady, who was represented by Mrs Wilbina Jackson, Commissioner for Education, advised the children to be good citizens and to complement the government’s efforts in Education.
