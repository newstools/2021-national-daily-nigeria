No fewer than 24 secessionist groups have been identified by the state police command as threats to the safety and security of Lagos state.
According to the State Commissioner of Police Hakeem Odumosu, the police is investigating the groups, including IPOB led by Nnamdi Kanu, Ilana Omo Oodua championed by Sunday Adeyemo aka Igboho, others, and their threats to Lagos.
“The Command has taken notice of agitators for Oodua Republic by some Yoruba separatist groups and the threats to disrupt law and order in the state. 24 of these groups have been identified and being closely monitored,’ he said during a state security summit Gov Babajide Sanwo-Olu chaired on Monday.
“Similarly, the threat of IPOB to attack soft targets in Lagos is equally being put on the radar of the command intelligence gathering and other security services in the state. Strategies are being put in place to neutralise their activities.”
Weeks ago, IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu ordered his group to shut down the southeast, Lagos and Abuja on May 30.
Odumosu therefore called on Lagosians to report any suspicious person or movement to security agencies.
He also urged the state government to immediately take urgent measures against commercial motorcycles, popularly known as Okada riders in the state.
Adeyemo too has been reported saying his group will start attacking targets across the southwest. His group had a campaign run in Lagos a month ago.
