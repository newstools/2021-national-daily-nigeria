The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Taraba Police Command, David Misal, was said to have confirmed the invasion, but assured that the situation had been brought under control.
The PPRO had disclosed that the Commissioner of Police in Taraba State, Ahmed Azare, has ordered the deployment of more officers to go in search of the invaders and also protect the community.
Moreover, the Chairman of Bali Local Government Area, Mahmud Musa, was said to have revealed that six persons were found dead between Jatau Kungana and Gazabu communities in the local government area.
The chairman narrated that the conflicts began in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area, Benue State, which shares a boundary with Taraba State. Musa said that some Fulani herdsmen were pursued from the Katsina-Ala territory who flee to Bali Local Government, but the fleeing herdsmen were resisted from entering the local government. The resistance, the chairman said, escalated the fight, leading to the death of six persons in the territory.
The Bali LG chairman said he has reached out to the leaders of both the Fulani herdsmen and the Tiv nation to caution their people to end hostilities and embrace peace.
The chairman assured that security operatives have taken up the nooks and crannies of the local government to avert further killings. He urged those using the opportunity to destroy or steal from houses to desist from such act.
