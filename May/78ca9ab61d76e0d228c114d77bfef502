Former Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has lost his place on Hertha Berlin’s supervisory board over a racist text message.
A spokesman for Hertha investor Lars Windhorst said on Wednesday that Lehmann is no longer an advisor for the company.
It was a position which had given him a place on the board of the Bundesliga club.
Lehmann was appointed by Windhorst’s company and onto the club board in place of former team coach Juergen Klinsmann a year ago.
Former Germany player Dennis Aogo, a pundit for Sky TV, had earlier shared a Whatsapp message from Lehmann on Instagram.
In it, Lehmann had asked: “Is Dennis your black person to meet the quota?”
Lehmann has apologised for the message on Twitter but the damage was done, with Hertha also welcoming that he is no longer on the club board.
“Hertha BSC distances itself from any form of racism,” club president Werner Gegenbauer said.
“Such statements in no way correspond to the values for which Hertha stands and actively campaigns.”
