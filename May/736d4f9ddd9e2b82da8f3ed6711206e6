The governor said that the equipment was to alert the flood-prone community to possible flooding in order to avert loss of lives and property.
He urged the residents to protect the equipment in the best interest of the community.
Sule also said that the inauguration of the project was part of activities to mark his second year in office.
“I am here as part of activities to mark my second year in office and to meet you and hear from you in order to take the state to the next level of development.
“It is important that I speak with the community who are directly involved in the project.
“The project looks like a small one to you. But it is an expensive project because of the amount of money we have invested in it.
“I call on you to do the best you can to protect the equipment. By the time that there is going to be a flood, the equipment will give warning,’’ he said.
Earlier, Sule paid a visit to the traditional ruler of the area  “Ohimege Opanda”  Alhaji Abdullahi Usman, to kick start his ‘meet the people tour’ of the state beginning  with the Umaisha community.
He lauded the traditional ruler for promoting peace in his domain.
“I am here to inaugurate the equipment, thank the people and to hear from them in the efforts to move the state to the next level of development,’’ Sule said.
Responding, the royal father appealed for the deployment of security troops to tackle banditry, kidnapping and other forms of criminality in the area.
“I also want to appeal for the establishment of tertiary institutions such as College of Education or College of Agriculture in Toto LGA, as well as the rehabilitation of the Toto-Umaisha road,’’ he said.
