Governor Ganduje, hosting the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, at the Government House, who was on a Sallah traditional Hawan Nassarawa on Saturday admitted: “It is true that the oldest mode of cattle movement from one end to the other, rather breed poverty and is no longer tenable.”
The governor, subsequently, pointed out that “however, the way and manner in which Fulani herders are subjected to untold maltreatment and agony in the southern part of the country is unacceptable, and this must change because they are equally Nigerians with the freedom to live anywhere.”
Governor Ganduje, therefore, reiterated his invitation that all herdsmen affected by the ban on open grazing in the south should return to Kano. He assured that the state has developed facilities for modern grazing of animals at Dansoshiya hush.
The Kano Governor stated that the Fulani should be allowed to travel freely across Nigeria.
Governor Ganduje expressed the view that the security crisis in the country should not be left only to President Muhammadu Buhari, saying that it is everyone’s responsibility, appealing that  everyone should be involved in finding solutions to the insecurity crisis.
