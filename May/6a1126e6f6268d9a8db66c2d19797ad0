Emerging reports indicate that coronavirus vaccines are becoming more dangerous than the virus itself.  A 17-year-old bot, Gregory Hatton, has been reported to be diagnosed with pericarditis few days after being administered second dose of coronavirus vaccine. His mother complained that the boy “basically has a heart condition now and it’s terrifying.”
In one week of investigation, 18 new cases of heart problems among teenagers were reported   by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on recipients of COVID vaccines. The 18 cases were said to be hospitalized.
“One individual that we’re aware of is still hospitalized,” Guifford said Monday. “The other 17 have been sent home and they’re doing fine.”
Rachel Hatton, mother of 17-year-old Gregory, narrated that her son started complaining of severe chest pain three days after second coronavirus vaccine dose. She added that the pain worsened on the fourth day, causing back pain.
It was revealed that after blood work and an x-ray, doctors diagnosed Gregory with pericarditis, an inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart that can cause sharp chest pain and other symptoms.
The mother narrated: “They hooked him up to a heart monitor, did more EKGs, echocardiograms. Infectious disease actually came and ran their own set of blood work to try to figure out if it could have been caused by something else, some sort of infection, something else, like Lyme disease. They tested him for all sorts of things and one by one those tests came back negative.”
