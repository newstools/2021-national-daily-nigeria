After launching series of sucker strikes that took out seven police officers in a number of LGAs, including Oyigbo, in Rivers, weeks ago, a group of IPOB militia men eventually had a dose of their own pills.
And the timing was most painful–their down time.
Acting on intelligence, a tactical team of the Nigerian police stole in on the premises at Irebe where four men with bullet injuries were taking treatment from a female nurse they hired.
The IPOB men were among those wounded in an earlier confrontation with police at the Elingbu Police Station weeks ago, while the bandits disguised as security men and unleashed terror on security agents at checkpoints.
The cops surrounded the makeshift clinic, and the first of the in-patients to attempt an escape was shot down; his already wounded fellow, though fitted with drip, put up an armed resistance still, and wanted to shoot their way out
And in the deadly confrontation, three of the IPO members were shot dead.
The nurse, Uchechi, who, according to reports by the Nation, was treating them was caught in the shoot-out. She died along with her patients.
“I can tell you that they are IPOB members,” a security source told the newspaper.
“Five registration booklets of IPOB, many charms and some arms were recovered from them. You need to see their body, which was previously riddled by bullet. Though the bullets may not kill them because of their charms, the effects and the injuries will still show.”
There is no official reaction yet from the Rivers police authorities.
Last week, Gov Nyesom Wike rolled out a new security strategy for the state, and he assured the citizens the secessionists behind the attacks on security agents will be fished out and dealt with.
