Media houses even went berserk with the news of his absence at the funeral of the late COAS Ibrahim Attahiru who died alongside 10 others in an air-crash in Kaduna Friday evening.
Osinbajo reportedly entered the facility of Reddington Hospital on the Island on Saturday around 10 am.
He was there till 2 pm.
A presidential source later confirmed the vice president was at the hospital for his annual medical checkup, and jetted back—to Abuja.
President Muhammadu Buhari always travels abroad, spending weeks, and months at times, for medical check-up in London.
