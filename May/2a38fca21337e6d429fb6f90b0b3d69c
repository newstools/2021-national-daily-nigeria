Biafra Nations League (BNL), on Saturday described the death of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, as a lesson to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Inspector General of Police and all Service Chiefs.
The BNL National Leader, Princewill Chimezie Richard, in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, noted that the Nigerian authorities issued shoot-at-sight order against Biafra agitators in the southeast and south-south, especially, in Imo State, where the Military were conducting seven days show of force. The BNL Leader declared that “Nigerian leaders should know that life is one,” noting that “anyone can die unexpectedly.”
Chimezie Richard had declared: “the President and Governors, including all Service Chiefs, are human beings who when they die would be buried like commoners. “No one has spare life, it’s unfortunate for them that after giving orders for execution against us, they die terribly…”
Princewill admonished the government against killing the citizens government is in place to protect.
