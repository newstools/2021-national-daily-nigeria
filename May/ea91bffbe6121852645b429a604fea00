He just made a statement dismissing self-appointed secessionist cheerleader Sunday Adeyemo who spoke at such rally in Akure on Saturday.
Adeyemo aka Igboho visited the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi, after the rally, claiming Akeredolu is in support of their agitation for a Yoruba nation.
Akeredolu, who stated that agitators of Yoruba nation are on their own, emphasized that he would never be in support of secessionists.
Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Richard Olatunde, disclosed the governor allowed Igboho and his followers to hold the rally because he recognized the right of individuals and groups to hold peaceful rallies.
“It must not be misconstrued to mean support for secessionist agenda and or balkanization of the nation. Far from it,” the governor said.
He noted whatever zeal he displayed is borne out of patriotism for Nigeria and love for the Yoruba ethnic nationality.
“It is important, therefore, to state without any equivocation that the Yoruba Nation secessionist promoters do not enjoy any lending hand in Governor Akeredolu.”
