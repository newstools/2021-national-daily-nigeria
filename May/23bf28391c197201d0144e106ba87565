“Let us not deceive ourselves that things are alright, things are not alright. We know it and we see it. For some of us, we have seen so much in our lives.
“Now things are really very bad. It doesn’t take anybody to know that Nigeria is in a very bad situation and it is a fact.
“In the last one and a half months, we have had three serious gatherings like this with the highest security echelons, leaderships in the country.
“Today, we are here once again to talk on the same issues of national security. I think enough of these talks, let us walk the talk.
“The more we sit here and talk, the more time we waste in taking real actions because we know the problems.”
