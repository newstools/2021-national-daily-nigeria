Former Arsenal boss Unai Emery returns to the Emirate with his Villarreal team to face his former employers in the semi final of the Europa League on Thursday night.
Meanwhile, current Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta and his side needed to beat Villarreal to salvage any hope of returning to the UEFA Champions League after their long absence from the top European competition.


The Gunners who fell to a 2-1 first-leg semi-final defeat against Villarreal – and their former coach Unai Emery in Spain last week were dealt a bitter blow with their goalless draw that saw Villarreal progressing to the finals at their expense.
The result has ended another hope of seeing two English clubs in the Europa League final as to be witnessed in the UEFA Champions League finals where Chelsea will be squaring up against Manchester City after their semi finals victories against Real Madrid and PSG respectively.
Many Gunners fans must have expected to see Arsenal face Manchester United in the Europa League finals after the latter though fell to a 2 – 3 defeat to Roma, but progressed on a 8 – 5 aggregate to face Villarreal in the finals.
