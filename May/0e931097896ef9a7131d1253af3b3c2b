Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra [IPOB], Nnamdi Kanu has said contrary to the report being circulated around, his group was not responsible for the killing of ex-political Adviser to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Gulak on Sunday.
Gulak was killed on his way to the airport in Owerri, where he was going to catch a flight to Abuja.
The Imo State Police Command Sunday night claimed four persons who participated in the murder have been killed dead in a shootout at Aboh-Mbaise.

However, in an audio message monitored by National Daily, Nnamdi Kanu said the murder was planned and executed by some federal government agents in collaboration with the British High Commissioner in Nigeria, Catriona Laing.
“Do you know that they wanted to kill this man on the day of the sit-at-home, not knowing that the day has been shifted to today? He was assassinated by El Rifai and Mungono, the two planned this assassination and cemented it is the British High Commissioner to Nigeria. Catriona Lang. They plan to kill him during our celebration, so as to blame it on the IPOB.
“This man told us about his killer before they killed him. And I’m going to play his voice for you. After playing his voice. I want his wife to demand the telephone records of her husband, from his last conversation, she will know the killer of her husband.
“We cannot touch people who have done nothing to us. That’s not how we roll. Do not touch people during the little businesses regardless of where they come from, you cannot touch them, please. So when something happens we can investigate very quickly, and find out,” he added.
