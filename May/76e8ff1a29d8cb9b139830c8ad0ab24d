Former Kaduna senator and popular social and political commentator, Senator Shehu Sani has taken a swipe at the Muslim Rights concern with a cryptic message over the group’s biased support for the government.
Senator Sani took to his Twitter page to advise the group to learn to speak truth to power like the catholic bishops.
In his words, he advised the revered men of God in MURIC to learn from the respected men of God in the Catholic Bishops Conference by courageously telling the God’s truth to the ‘gods’.

It is not known whom Sani referred to as the ‘gods’ but it is possible that he may be referring to the Nigerian government.
Amid the insecurity and chaos in the country, the catholic bishops’ conference had advised the president to be more proactive in tackling the insecurity and the unrelenting crises in the nation.
The Catholic bishops had spoken during a meeting held last week.
The leader of the Catholic Bishops conference and catholic Bishop of Benin, Augustine Akubeze had berated the Buhari administration for blackmailing critics of the government.
The Bishops’ conference had also advised the FG that Nigeria belongs to everyone and that citizens had the right to air out their grievances and opinions when it matters.
On the other hand, the MURIC has always been known and seen as a branch of the Buhari-led FG as they always support the government.

Shehu Sani’s advice comes at a time when the country is clamoring for the Presidency to seat up and nip all forms of criminality in the bud.
He believes if perhaps, MURIC joins in the calls to ask the presidency to wake up to its responsibilities, it would go a long way to let the FG know Nigerians are not happy about the turn of events in the country.
