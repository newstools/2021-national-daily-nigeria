Ebonyi Governor David Umahi has threatened traders who comply with the Monday sit-at-home order by IPOB should be ready to forfeit their shops.
Rather than sit at home, traders should arm themselves for self-protection, and go about their daily activities, the governor added.
Umahi issued the warning in a state-wide broadcast on Saturday in Abakaliki to mark the sixth anniversary of his administration.
He was reacting to the order by the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) to the people of South-East zone.
“There should be free movement of people in the state on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and other days of the year,” he said.
“People should go to church on Sunday to pray for the nation’s fallen security agents, civilians and peace and unity of the state and country.
“I challenge the youths, local government area chairman, security agents, Ebubeagu security outfit, among others, to ensure that no one is molested in the state.
“Anyone who has nothing to protect himself should do so with cutlass, which should be for protection and not for attack.”
He said that all forms of procession had been banned in the state except those by youths organised by council chairmen.
“I have been notified about such processions and they are being used to profile our people for empowerment.
“I charge the Ebubeagu security outfit, which is backed by the state laws, to ensure that the people are protected,” Umahi said.
He said the state could not go into “second slavery under any guise”, pointing out that “the secession the people need is massive economic development.
“There will be movement in other parts of the country, if there is none in the South-East. So people should therefore ignore such order.
