Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Thursday commiserated with the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, and his wife, Pastor Folu Adeboye, on the death of their beloved son, Pastor Dare Adeboye.
The governor highlighted that Pastor Dare Adeboye, an Assistant Pastor in charge of Youth in Region 35 of RCCG and third surviving child of the renowned cleric, died in his sleep on Wednesday in Eket, Akwa Ibom State. He was 42-year-old.
Governor Sanwo-Olu in a statement on Thursday by his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, expressed his heartfelt sympathies, urging the deceased family, friends, associates and entire members of RCCG to take the death of Pastor Dare Adeboye in good faith.
Governor Sanwo-Olu said: “no doubt the death of a loved one is usually painful as it is irreparable, but we must always take solace in God especially if the deceased had lived a good life, just like the late pastor Dare Adeboye.”
He said “The pastoral and wise counsel of Pastor D as he was fondly called will be sorely missed by his family and the entire members of RCCG, especially in Eket, Akwa Ibom, where he played active roles as a cleric before he passed on.
“I sympathise with Pastor Enoch Adeboye, his wife, siblings and widow of the deceased and the entire members of RCCG. I pray that God will grant the late Pastor Dare Adeboye eternal rest and grant the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.”
