The corpse of the unidentified hawker, a male, lay beside a crate of table water he sold. His umbrella was there, too, with blood stains on his trousers.
The incident happened May 26.
The Lagos state authorities and the state police command have yet to respond to the incident.
Lagos has been battling the problem of street hawking, especially on major highways in the state.
In spite of the state environmental law that forbids and punishes street hawking, more and more residents are taking to the risky occupation.
Many will blame poverty for it.
