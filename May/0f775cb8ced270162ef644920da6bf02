There are emerging anxieties as the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, on Wednesday assured all loyalists not to be perturbed about intimidation, promising that guns will be distributed to those involved in the struggle for the independence of Biafra.  Kanu’s assurance was gathered to have precipitated apprehension over the activities of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), a security architecture established to contain the crisis of insecurity in the southeast.
Nnamdi Kanu in a tweet on his official handle on Wednesday declared: “Don’t worry about guns, for guns will be well distributed on that day. It is no secret. -Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.”
However, a citizen, responding, cautioned against throwing the country into war like the days of Ojukwu.
“That was how we were led into war by Ojukwu that year. When the war took off, there wasn’t enough gun for the gallant Biafran soldiers, despite all the foreign support and him being a military man,” the citizen declared.
Another stakeholder from the southeast @amadi_ogbonna also wrote: “My fellow Biafrans, what happened to Rev Fr Ejike Mabake has proved me right by telling you that the real enemies we have to be free as Biafrans is the hidden church authorities in our land. Let us continue because it will later be clear to everyone, time shall tell.”
Another stakeholder from the southeast expressed enthusiasm in being given one of the guns to be distributed by Nnamdi Kanu. According to him, @Emperor_K_E
“I will be positively anticipating my own. I can’t wait.”
Another stakeholder @OlojaYinka
expressed that “When there’s a gun, there’s much hope…” He counseled: “Learn how to fight and run, for you to be able to fight tomorrow.”
Kanu has continued to increase the confidence of the separatist agitators in the southeast, even after IPOB has been proscribed by the Nigerian government.
