“Children’s Day is a day when children are the protagonist of the world,’’ Moon told the kids.
He expressed regret that he was meeting them via video links due to COVID-19.
“It is my biggest wish to enable you to play with friends, with masks off, as early as possible. Let’s make efforts together, while abiding by virus control and prevention rules, so that such a day can come as soon as possible,’’ he added.
Moon said that he likes Pyeongchang, where the school was situated, especially as the 2018 Winter Olympic Games took place there.
