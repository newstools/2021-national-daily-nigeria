Fasina, in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media Matters, Wole Balogun, in Oye-Ekiti, described the advertisement of job vacancies on social media as fake.
The vice-chancellor described the purported vacancy advert as the handiwork of fraudsters.
The statement read, “The attention of management of FUOYE has been drawn to a fake announcement that the university is currently recruiting to fill academic and non- academic vacancies.
“The fake announcement, which is created to defraud members of the public, has gone viral on social media.
“FUOYE is currently not recruiting and whenever the need arises for the announcement of an authentic recruitment exercise, it will be made known through several channels of communication, such as print and electronic media, not just on the social media alone.
“We wish to categorically state that the said announcement is fake and it is the handiwork of fraudulent people, who are determined to tarnish the good image of our upwardly mobile citadel of learning.
The statement advised members of the public to always endeavour to contact the institution directly and also put calls through to the appropriate channels to confirm such information in the future before making an attempt to access them.
“In this age of social media, many people are devising several fraudulent means to defraud innocent members of the public.
“Members of the public, especially our youths seeking gainful employment, are urged to ignore the announcement currently spreading on social media, in their own interest,” it said.
