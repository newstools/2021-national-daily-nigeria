Kaduna Gov. Nasir El Rufai has declared him and others wanted.
The labour protest was in opposition to the state’s police of sacking more government workers.
In a tweet yesterday, the governor said the NLC and its protest displayed some unlawful actions:  “shutting down electricity, coercion and restraints of personal freedom, trespass into public facilities and denial of access to healthcare for several of our citizens.”
“They closed several hospitals and chased away the patients,” he added.
Giving an update today, El-rufai tweeted again:
“KADUNA UPDATE: Ayuba Wabba & others of @NLCHeadquarters declared wanted for economic sabotage & attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act. Anyone that knows where he is hiding should send a message to @MOJKaduna KDSG. There will be a handsome reward!”
The NLC said the governor has sacked well over 70,000 since he got to office.
