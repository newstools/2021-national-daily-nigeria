Kidnappers of the 23 students and a member of staff of Greenfield University, Kaduna have raised ransom for the remaining 16 students in their den to N160 million.
Recall that 23 students and the matron of the female student hostel were abducted from the university on April 20, 2021.
Five of the students were killed a few days after the abduction following what the kidnappers called the failure of the parents and the school management to pay N800 hitherto demanded by them.

They had earlier reduced the N500 million they sought as ransom when the students were 17 to N100 million. The kidnappers also asked that 10 brand-new Honda motorcycles be delivered to them as part of the conditions for the freedom of the abductees.
But the bandits made a U-turn on Monday, and demanded that each parent pay N10 million to their child.
One of the parents who confirmed the development said: “They (bandits) called today(yesterday) and asked me to bring N10 million to get my child out.

“We don’t even know what to do now. They initially asked for N100 million for all the children, after we had paid them more than N55 million. With this now, it means they are asking for N160 million because there are 16 of our children with them presently.
“We are helpless. When we told them we could not raise N100 million collectively; where do they want us to get N160 million?”
The bandits last week issued a threat to kill the remaining captives if the ransom which they later reduced to N100 million was not paid by last Tuesday.
