General Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, CGCC, Pastor Tunde Bakara, has urged Nigerian youths to take control of Nigeria and return it to its glory days.
Pastor Bakare who stated this while speaking at the maiden edition of the Conversation Africa Series which was organized by the Legacy Youth Fellowship in Lagos, said the country has seen determined young Nigerians fired up and ready to take their country back from the so-called gerontocrats.
He said: “Young Nigerians are asking why a country so rich wears the inglorious badge of the poverty capital of the world.

“Our current youths need to be reminded that on May 24, 1966, a 31-year-old Head of State destroyed the foundation of federalism and made Nigeria a unitary system and also in mid-1970’s some young and zealous army generals in their 30’s overthrew the government in their bid to sanitize the system but ended up destroying it among other incident.
“Young Nigerian patriots, you can see from this brief recourse to history that Nigeria was brought to its current state, not necessarily by gerontocrats, but by mostly young Nigerians, some of whom had been actively involved in governance from their 20’s, 30’s and 40’s, and some of whom are relevant even now. It is why I say that youth, in a sense, brought us here.”
