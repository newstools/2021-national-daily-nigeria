NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the sanctions that the European Union imposed on Belarus following the forced landing of a Ryanair flight.
“The forced landing of a passenger flight by Belarus was dangerous and unacceptable,’’ he said after a meeting with Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.
“This is a state hijacking and demonstrates how the regime in Minsk attacks basic democratic rights and cracks down on freedom of expression and independent media.
“ I welcome the additional measures agreed by the European Union,’’ he said, adding that an urgent international investigation was needed.
NATO members will meet later in the day to discuss the issue.
