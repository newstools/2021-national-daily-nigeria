The last of the three abducted students of Kings School, otherwise known as Capro Secondary Mission School located at Gana Ropp in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau, has regained freedom.
Gunmen on April 29 kidnapped the students in Capro, a few kilometres away from the Yakubu Gowon airport and about 60 kilometres from Jos.
Two of the students escaped while one remained in captivity.
On Sunday, the spokesman of Operation Safe Haven, Major Ibrahim Shittu, said troops rescued the remaining student in captivity on Saturday. No ransom was paid.
He said the rescue operation was achieved through the sustained search and rescue efforts of the troops.
According to the military spokesman, the rescued student is in good health condition and has since been reunited with other students in the college.
More than 20 students of the Greenfield University kidnapped in Kaduna weeks ago are still in captivity, after their parents.
