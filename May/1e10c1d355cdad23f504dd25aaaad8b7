Agusto projected in its report that the country’s remittance record will get better this year as recipients of the funds are allowed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to get their funds in foreign currency.
It also stated that the remittance flow will increase as more well-educated Nigerians migrate out of the country. Stimulus packages provided by foreign governments in their countries will also contribute to the rise in capital inflow into Nigeria.
According to Agusto’s head, Jimi Ogbobine, there will be improvement in 2021, as remittance will increase to $22 billion, and $22.5 billion by 2022.
