Gunmen have reportedly killed three policemen during an attack on Nsukwa Police Divisional Headquarters, Aniocha South LGA.
While the details of the attacks are still sketchy, it was learnt the attack, which occurred around 1.00am on Sunday, led to collapse of parts of the roof of the police station.
It was gathered that an uneasy calm has enveloped Nsukwa, a small agrarian community, following the attack with residents fleeing to neighbouring communities as the gunmen, who arrived on foot, launched the attack from a thick forest behind the ill- fortified station.
