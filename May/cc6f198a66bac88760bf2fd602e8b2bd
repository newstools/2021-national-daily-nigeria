As police and the militia arm of IPOB regularly clash in deathly confrontations across the southeast, training and combat-readiness now determines police survival.
The IPOB bad guys just took out two police officers during an attack the militia launched around 11 on Wednesday at the Obosi police station, Idemili North LGA.
According to eyewitnesses and reports, the dead police officers got trapped inside a filling station office while they engaged the invading bandits—crammed into 10 vehicles, armed with guns and other weapons.
“The two inspectors that died during the gun duel were targeted inside a non-functional filling station close to the police station,” a source confided in the Daily Trust.
“They were firing shots in a move to repel the gunmen from entering the police station but were overpowered.”
Apparently, the militants overran the station, and the remaining officers standing fled the station. The attackers then broke out suspects in custody, and torched the facility.
In similar attacks in other states of the southeast, cops that got killed were mostly in bad position at the point of attack, making them sitting ducks.
In about seven incidents, no fewer than seven police officers have been killed in Anambra since January.
Abia has recorded no fewer than six deaths, as of mid-April.
On the Anambra attack, the police command’s spokesman DSP Tochukwu Ikenga said CP Christopher Adetokunbo had dispatched a tactical team for an on the spot assessment of the incident.
“The tactical team led by an assistant commissioner of police was equally told to identify and apprehend the hoodlums that perpetrated the attack,” he said.
