For the first time in months, IPOB militia and bandits attacking police installations across the northeast got whitewashed when they made another attempt on Imo divisional police headquarters at Orlu Thursday night.
A joint security team engaged the gunmen and took out eight of them during the three-hour-long shootout.
Eyewitnesses also said no fewer than six vehicles were recovered from the hoodlums during the attack.
The first time the miscreants came was almost simultaneous with the attack on the Owerri Correctional facility early in April.
Suspects in the police holding cells were broken out during the attacks on the police headquarters. The gunmen equally tried to access the police armoury, but they didnâ€™t succeed.
Imo Police Public Relations Officer, SP Ikeokwu Godson Orlando has yet o make an official statement on the April 6 attack.
