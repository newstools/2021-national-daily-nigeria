Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed yesterday said most acts of criminality, such as banditry and kidnapping, were being perpetrated by those of the Islamic faith.
He urged Muslims not to harbour criminals but to courageously hand them over to security agencies.
The governor spoke after performing the Eid prayers to mark the Sallah celebration.
He urged the Federal Government to work towards improving the security architecture, adding that tackling insecurity is a collective effort.
”’We know these bandits. We know where they stay and what they do. Sometimes we aid and abt them.
“We should fish them out because the police in their limited numbers are already overwhelmed due to insufficient human capital.
