EFCC chairman Abdulrasheed Bawa stated this in the current edition of the commission’s magazine EFCC Alerts.
Diezani left Nigeria for Lodon when her boss President Goodluck Jonathan lost his re-election bid in 2015.
Former EFCC boss Ibarhim Magu made effort in that direction, and at a point he cried out over the challenges he had with the UK authorities in extraditing Diezani whose many malpractices are yet to be unravelled.
“There are several cases surrounding Diezani’s case. I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. The other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation,” said Bawa.
“We are looking forward to the time we will, maybe, have her in the country, and, of course, review things and see what will happen going forward. The case has certainly not been abandoned.’’
