Share this on WhatsAppManchester United suffered their fifth and sixth home defeats against Leicester City and Liverpool respectively within the space of 50 hours.
These defeats however were experienced in the absence of their fans with no thanks to the covid-19 pandemic that has sadly forced supporters away from the stadiums.
Thankfully, football fans have been billed to witness the last games of their respective clubs.
Sequel to the above, United fans are expected to make a return to the Old Trafford to cheer their team against the already relegated Fulham come May 15th.
Solskjaer who blamed the last two home defeats to Leicester and Liverpool to the nature of the congestion of the fixtures and partly to fan discontent to disrupt their planning is however hopeful that the return of fans at Old Trafford against Fulham can usher in some degree of positivity back to the club.
“I didn’t want to use it as an excuse because we lost two games, but surely it’s reason behind the performances,” Solksjaer said.
“Physically it’s impossible to play at the intensity that’s required because of the amount of games. Then you look at the preparation in between and we haven’t had the recovery and the same routine as we normally would and we haven’t done the tactical preparation.”
In furtherance to Solskjaer’s above claim, National Daily can confirm that United’s players spent hours in the stadium and beds were delivered so they could rest ahead of the Liverpool game amid fears of major demonstrations.
“It’s never nice to see a club that is not united. We’re hoping Tuesday is going to be a positive day and that we move together.
“The mood in any club and the relationship between the team and the fans is vital to what happens on the pitch. Hopefully the players will give the fans a reason to cheer. That’s what we have to focus on.
“It’s a big game for us in that respect.”
