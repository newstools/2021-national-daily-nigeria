Nollywood Actor Yomi Fabiyi and others are protestig at the Panti police station—against the detention of his colleague, Olanrewaju Omiyinka, aka Baba Ijesha accused of sexually assaulting a minor.
Fabiyi and other protesters marched from Casino Bus Stop to Panti Police Station, Yaba, Lagos, on Wednesday, carrying placards and banners.
“Nigeria police, please allow the law to dictate to you, not Iyabo Ojo, Princess and co’, ‘Release Baba Ijesha’, and ‘Nigeria police must respect human rights and honour bail for bailable offence’,
Fabiyi has been supportive of Baba Ijesha.
There have been various versions of the incident since Baba Ijesha was arrested.
It’s been reported he dated the minor and her foster mum Princess, a comedienne. The minor had been pregnant even before now, and Princess aborted it.
Fabiyi has insisted Princess set the man up, and a lot more will be spilled if Baba Ijesha is charged to court instead of holding him in detention.
