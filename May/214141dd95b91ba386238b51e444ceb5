Share this on WhatsAppOutgoing Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick said on Friday he was in no rush to decide on a possible job as German national team coach.
Flick is the top candidate to take over from Joachim Loew, whose assistant he was from 2006 to 2014, after this summer’s European Championships.
He is currently in talks with German Football Federation director Oliver Bierhoff.
Loew will step down after the Euro 2020 event and Flick is being released early from his contract to 2023 by Bayern Munich after the May 22 Bundesliga finale.
“I always said that I feel no pressure. Of course the talks are good, but there is nothing more to say about it,” Flick said.
“I have two games remaining. I have a task here, a job to do. That is very important for me because the team is very important for me.”
Bierhoff had said on Thursday he was “positive” that Flick would become the new coach and expressed hope the deal could be sealed before the June 11 start of the Euros.
“My wish will be to complete it before the Euros so that you don’t have to talk about the issue at the Euros,” Bierhoff said.
“I am positive. Of course you can never be sure, but we are having good talks. Of course he has to consider a few things, you have to give him time. We all wish to have him as national team coach.”
