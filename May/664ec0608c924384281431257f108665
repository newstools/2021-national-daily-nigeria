The plan focused on the identity of the threat—doomed secessionists—and their mode of operation.
“We have reviewed the way and manner the recent attacks were executed and discovered that the perpetrators, who disguised themselves as security officers, moved in unhindered from Oyigbo to launch the attack,” Wike said in a state broadcast on Monday.
He assured that security agencies are on their trail and the attackers will all be arrested soon and brought to justice.
“We wish to assure every resident that we are not intimidated by the sporadic and cowardly attacks on predetermined security targets by faceless criminals on our soil; neither will we be cowed into succumbing to a baseless and doomed secessionists agenda,” the governor added.
The new strategy now includes a review of the existing night time curfew across the 23 Local Government Areas, which will now start from 7 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. until further notice from tomorrow 11th May 2021.
There is still a restriction on youth itching to stand up to the secessionists.
“We don’t want to complicate our very delicate security situation by creating opportunities for some other monsters to emerge.”
He further appealed to Rivers citizens to make security everybody’s business and play their own roles, especially in passing intelligence information to the law enforcement agencies to process and take pre-emptive measures to counter and advance our collective security.
Dozens of security agents, including policemen, soldiers, have been killed, nd sometimes burnt, at checkpoints in some of the local government areas.
