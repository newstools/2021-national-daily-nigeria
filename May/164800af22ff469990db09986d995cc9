The party acknowledged the legal victory as the inevitable triumph of the will of the people over anti-democratic forces.
The PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, asserted that the verdict of the apex court in throwing out the petition of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is a resounding reinforcement of the popularity of the PDP and Governor Obaseki in Edo State, as firmly established in the election.
The PDP urged Governor Obaseki to continue in his commitment towards the development of the state and the well being of his people in line with the manifesto and ideology of the PDP; the very reason he was overwhelmingly re-elected as governor of the state.
