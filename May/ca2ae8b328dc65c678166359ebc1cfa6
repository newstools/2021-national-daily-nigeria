Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has finally crushed his political opponents in Edo who include former Governor Adams Oshiomhole, 2020 governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iymau, and others. It has become clear to all opponents of Governor Obaseki that his victory cannot be upturned by any court in the land.
The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the forgery suit filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) against Governor Obaseki for lack of merit.
The judgement sealed the hope of removing Governor Obaseki, from office through the court. The governor was sued in conjunction with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
The Court of Appeal in Benin had earlier upheld the victory of Governor Obaseki in the 2020 governorship election.
The Elections Petitions Tribunal had two months ago, struck out the petition by the Action Democratic Party (ADP) and its governorship candidate, Iboi Lucky.
Apparently, all the political opponent plotting to remove Governor Obaseki from office through the court have failed at the highest court in the country.
