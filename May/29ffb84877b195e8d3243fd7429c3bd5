IN March Benue Gov. Samuel Ortom claimed he was attacked on his farm along Goko highway by armed Fulani herders and he ha to run kilometer for his dear life. Now police says he’s wrong.
Acting IGP Usman Baba said investigations so far show that the outcome is contrary to the claim made by the governor.
“Those who organised and those who pulled the trigger have all been arrested and investigation is ongoing,” he said Thursday at a special briefing in Aso Rock.
“We have had them for over a month but the courts have been closed for over three months, where do I take them to?” he said.
Ortom’s claim then was rejected by Fulani organization and many on social media who saw gaps in the narrative of the governor.
Benue has been witnessing escalation in farmer-herder crisis since 2016, and hundreds of lives have been lost.
The governor recently advised his citizens to start defending and protecting themselves.
