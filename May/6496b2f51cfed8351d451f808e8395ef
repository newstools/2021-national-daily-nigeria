Legal luminary and owner of Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti (ABUAD), has announced a national conference he alone conveys and sponsors to tackle the current crisis rocking Nigeria.
To that effect, he also donated N50m and releases his varsity’s 700-seater hall and five-star hotel on the campus of the institution.
Babalola made this bold move at the 10th Aare Afe Babalola Annual Public Lecture, organised by the Ado Ekiti branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA).
The senior advocate tried to clarify the difference between his own conference and others calling for dissolution, saying he just wants to stop the country from drifting into war and anarchy.
He said restructuring and forming a new constitution were key to turning things around for the better.
Those invited include all former presidents and all leading traditional rulers.
The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, who was at the event hailed the decision of Babalola, promised to sell the idea to the National Council of Traditional in Nigeria.
There have been calls from different quarters urging the APC government to call one kind of emergency summit or the other.
But President Muhammadu Buhari has insisted there’s no reason for that.
The presidency rather warns ‘some former leaders and religious leaders’ trying to mastermind a coup to dislodge Buhari.
