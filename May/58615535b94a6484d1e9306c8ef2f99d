“The social media saga has eroded the substance of destiny as it has unconsciously robbed youths of their future and their time.
The honour of this generation has been wiped off, chatting all day with no time left to think, plan program and engage productively in the pursuit of any task.
“Some professionals have classified social media addiction along with drugs, alcohol and sex.
“Social media that is supposed to be a plus to the youths, suddenly became a minus, as everything of value is delivered through the investment of time,” he said.
Oyedepo noted that life without a vision was an adventure in frustration and that life without a bearing was a burden.
He said only those who know where they are going ever get anywhere.
“No one ever arrives at a future he cannot see, neither does anyone arrive at a future he is not prepared for.
“It is time for every youth to wake up from slumber and take his/her destiny in their hands,” he added.
