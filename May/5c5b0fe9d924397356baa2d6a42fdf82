Share this on WhatsAppYoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has warned that any attack by the Nigerian Army on the South-East will be repelled.
A terse statement by Igboho’s media aide, Olayomi Koiki, said that any attack against Biafra should be considered an attack against the Yoruba, vowing to mobilise his followers in defence of the Eastern region.
He urged the government to put a stop to raids in the South-East region.
“We would like to inform the Federal Government of Nigeria that any attack on the South-East is an attack on the Yorubas.
“Biafra people have been targeted by the Nigeria Army and if there are any further attacks on them, we would have no other option but to support our brothers and sisters in Biafraland.”
