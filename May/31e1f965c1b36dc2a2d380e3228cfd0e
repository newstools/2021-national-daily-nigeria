Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Wednesday shared memories of late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, 11 years after death.  Jonathan celebrated late Yar’Adua as a leader with vision of a peaceful, united, and just country.
Former President wrote on his official twitter handle @GEJonathan “Today, I celebrate my boss, friend, colleague and brother, President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, who departed this world 11 years ago.
“As politicians, we shared a common vision of a peaceful, united and just nation.
“We will always remember him as a peacemaker, nation builder and democrat whose timeline was defined by virtues of service, peace, truth and love. – GEJ”
Some other stakeholders also acknowledged the spirit of fairness and equity late Yar’Adua demonstrated when he was President of Nigeria before his sudden death.
One of the stakeholders wrote: “President Yar’Adua kept faith with this vision, channeling his strength and time in pursuit of an egalitarian society, until his last breath. Although out of our sight, his legacies live with us and his memory we will continue to cherish.”
 
Also @Doogadavidkyobo added: “Thank you Mr. President for sharing in such a wonderful vision. The likes of Yar’Adua and you will always be missed and remembered for what you stood for. We miss and love you dearly, Sir, how we wish we could all turn back the hand of the clock, Sir.”
Yar’Adua died in May 2010 and Jonathan stepped in to complete the tenure as Vice President then. Former President Jonathan sustained the electoral reform started by President Yar’Adua before his death.
