Billionaire tech-preneur Elon Musk is about concluding plans to set up one of his futuristic businesses in Nigeria.
The ministry of communication and digtal economy revealed the plan has been on for months, and all will soon be wrapped up.
Musk is adding satellite internet service to his array of businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX.
The NCC said his company, Starlink will soo acquire necessary licenses for the satellite-based broadband service in Nigeria
SpaceX and NCC will have a face-to-tace interaction for further understanding of the proposal.
“As the regulator of a highly dynamic sector in Nigeria, the commission is conscious of the need to ensure that our regulatory actions are anchored on national interest,” Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska, said.
“We have listened to your presentation and we will review it vis-à-vis our regulatory direction of ensuring effective and a sustainable telecoms ecosystem where a licensee’s operational model does not dampen healthy competition among other licensees.”
The SpaceX’s team was led by SpaceX’s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, Ryan Goodnight.
Providers of broadband services include MainOne and major telecoms operators in Nigeria who largely depend on optic fibre.
The NCC said it’s interested inthe competition Musk’s Starlink will bring, but wants to take due diligence to make the competition healthy.
