During an interaction with newsmen, the  commissioner of police said  that from  Feb. 22 till date, the command charged 205 cases to court.
He said: “120 of the cases are from  divisional offices and area commands while 85 are from the criminal investigation bureau.
“Also, 131 suspects are awaiting trial in prison custody because they committed crimes ranging from armed robbery to cultism.
“Arrest cannot be made without recovery of arms. As such, 32 arms were recovered: six AK47, one G3, three double-barrel guns and 22 locally-made pistols.
“The locally-made pistols are much because blacksmiters are helping them to fabricate the guns.”
He said  that 726 rounds of ammunition were also  recovered with 27 live cartridges, adding  that the command had been proactive in tackling criminality.
“We are enforcing the laws of both the federation and the state,” he said.
