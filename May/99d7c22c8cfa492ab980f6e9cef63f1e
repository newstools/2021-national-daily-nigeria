Edison Cavani joined Manchester United in 2020 on a one year deal and with an option of an additional year.
The Uruguayan though has long defied his initial difficult start to life in England and has gradually reignited his talismanic form for United with 15 goal so far in his 28 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils when he came off the bench to score his 15th goal in United’s 3-1 victory away against Aston Villa on Sunday.
There has been disquiet over the former Napoli hitman’s contract extension at Old Trafford as the 34-year-old was undecided over whether to stay for a second year after experiencing a number of issues early in his time with the club.
National Daily gathered from the report by BBC Sport that those matters have been resolved with an agreement for an extension being reached.
Though United have not confirmed it, but National Daily understands that it is but a matter of time.
This development will definitely be a good news for the Red Devils fans and mostly United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who has not hidden his desires to retain the services of the former PSG forward at Old Trafford beyond this season.
