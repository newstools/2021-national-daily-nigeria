The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says the recent action of the All Progressives Congress has confirmed the general opinion in the public space that the APC has lost touch with reality and as such is no longer in sync with the fears, anxieties and aspirations of Nigerians having lost total bearing with the essence of governance.
In a statement signed by the party’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP condemns the desperate attempt by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to frustrate the aspiration of Nigerians in finding solutions to the alarming state of insecurity and economic hardship in the country.

“By criticizing the PDP governors meeting and communique, the APC, as a party, has further showcased its internal failures in steering the ship of state on the right course thereby pushing our country towards a state of anarchy.
“It is only a fizzling political association like the APC that would attempt to politicize and deride a clear consensus by Nigerians as expressed in the coming together of state governors, who are seeking for the restoration of sovereignty in a near hopeless situation.
He said the APC, as a party, must however realize that Nigerians have already moved beyond its partisan and divisive machinations; that prominent citizens including many governors and other leaders elected on the platform of the APC are already with the PDP in this genuine effort to rescue and secure our nation.
“It is only an insensitive state governor that will cross his fingers and do nothing while his people are being ravaged by hunger and starvation just because he wants to be in the good books of a failed ruling party.

“Finding solutions to the myriad of problems plaguing our nation today under the watch of a crisis-ridden APC and absentee President Muhammadu Buhari, has led to an imperative national call that requires the collective action of all, and the PDP, as a party, will not relent in leading all patriots in this charge.
The PDP therefore states that no group, no matter their machination, can gag Nigerians, let alone governors elected on the platform of the PDP, in seeking solutions to our challenges as a nation.
