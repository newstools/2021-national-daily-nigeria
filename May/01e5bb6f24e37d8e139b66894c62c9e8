“Our people are unpredictable. There might be emergence of third party to counter the two existing ones (PDP and APC) if Asiwaju Tinubu is denied presidential ticket by APC in 2023,” said former Hon. Shaeed Akinade-Fijabi.
He spoke on a live radio programme in Ibadan, Oyo, May 15.
Tinubu has yet to declare his intention for the top job come 2023.
But political groups and campaign organizations have sprung up, preparing the way for him, having observed hidden body language.
Even if Tinubu declares eventually, he will still have challenges even in the southwest traditional believed to be his stronghold in the party.
His party man and Ekiti Gov. Kayode Fayemi seems interested, too.
And the state chapter of the APC has even been divided over the governor’s perceived ambition, which doesn’t sit well with Tinubu’s loyalists.
