The House of Representatives has asked the Federal Government to suspend the proposed 2021 census due to the rising spate of insecurity across the country, citing that conducting such exercise when many Nigerians have been displaced from their homes is a breach of “constitutional rights.”
Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had in 2020 approved the disbursement of N10 billion to the National Population Commission (NPC), for the continuation of the Enumeration Area Demarcation (EAD) in the remaining Local Government Area (LGA) of the country.
The FG also approved an additional N45 billion, which is to be included in the 2021 Budget for completion of the exercise, as part of the preparations for the next census.

However, in a motion moved at the Wednesday plenary session by Rep. Shehu Beji (APC-Niger) on the floor of the House on Wednesday, in Abuja, asked the FG to suspend the proposed 2021 census due to the rising spate of insecurity across the country.
“In the circumstance, a large number of Nigerians have fled their homes, while many others are being held captive by kidnappers.
As such, conducting such a census without them means infringing on their constitutional right. Posting enumerators or ad hoc staff to volatile areas of the nation in the name of conducting census will be irrational, as it would be like giving them out to criminals,” the Rep said.
Rep Shehu Beji added that conducting a census might be a waste of depleting government revenues, also citing that with the coming 2023 elections, there won’t be time for census activities as campaigns resume.
The House of Reps agreed on a suspended Federal census until the rising state of insecurity is controlled and also invited the Chairman of the National Population Commission to ask if a census is feasible in 2021.
