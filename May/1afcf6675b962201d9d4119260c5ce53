The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has dismissed reports that it intends to collect Nigerians’ phone identification numbers.
The NCC Director of Public Affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde, who reacted to the reports in a statement on Friday, said the commission has no plan to collect mobile network subscribers’ International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) from July.

Recall that there were reports earlier In the day that the NCC had announced that beginning from July, Nigerians will be required to submit the IMEI of their phones.
This was allegedly stated by the regulatory body in the Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration.
However, in a statement by the regulatory agency on Friday, Adinde said the reports in question emanated from a section of the Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration recently launched by President Muhammadu Buhari and which has been uploaded on the commission’s website.

“It is pertinent to state that the commission is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS). The DMS will essentially protect subscribers against phone theft and will identify and enable the elimination of fake devices from the networks. The system will capture IMEI automatically without any requirement for subscribers to submit same.”
Adinde, therefore, advised Nigerians to disregard the reports.
