Local airlines in the country have intensified effort to attracting more patronage with the introduction of new incentives.
While some airlines upgrade the tickets of their patrons from Economy to Business Class, others give surprise gifts like HMO cards to passengers on board.
These loyalty programs have been introduced to boost the airlines’ revenues, as one of the survival strategies to surmount the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the leading operators, Air Peace,
launched its “random act of love” initiative in April 2021.
The acclaimed biggest airline has been exciting its passengers with numerous gifts onboard. The campaign aims to put a smile on the faces of customers who choose Air Peace.
According to sources, the airline places gift cards in random seat pockets. During the flight, passengers will be instructed to check the front seat pocket to see if they have won a gift.

The spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Orisa, boasted of his company’s commitment to providing unparalleled flight experience and thanked all their customers for the continued patronage.
He said, “This is an extension of the airline’s Random Love Act campaign, aimed at demonstrating a customer’s love for flying with the airline. Also with the card, you enjoy certain Business Class privileges when flying.”
Hot on the heels of Air Peace, is Azman Air which claims to have reduced airfares since the lifting of its ban by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the apex regulator of the aviation industry in Nigeria.
For instance, the cost of a flight from Lagos to Kano, which was N72,458, was dropped to N52,983. That is not all.
Last week, the airline also started rewarding its loyal passengers with free ticket upgrades from Economy to Business Class.
