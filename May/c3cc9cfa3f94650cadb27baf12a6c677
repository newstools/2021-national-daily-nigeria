The government is apparently imposing evidence of having received coronavirus vaccine as ticket or criterion for accessing government services or patronage.
In the United States of America (USA), governments across different states, are working out alliances with private corporations to ensure that the imposing of coronavirus vaccines is successfully implemented. The private corporations are collaborating with state and local governments to subtly enforce digital vaccine passports, compelling American citizens and residents to tender papers proofing they have received coronavirus vaccines before being admitted into the universities, access airlines, enter libraries, hotels, cruise ships, sports arenas and other kinds of business providing public services.
It was gathered that Rutgers University, Boston University and Notre Dame have stipulated that students must show proof of having received coronavirus vaccine COVID before returning to school in the fall.
The State of New York had on March 26 commenced Excelsior Pass system, developed in cooperation with IBM, for certain large-gathering events including sports, theaters, concert halls and other venues.
Also, Health officials in Orange County, California, declared a digital passport that “enables individuals to participate safely and with peace of mind in activities that involve interactions with other people, including travel, attractions, conferences/meetings, concerts, sports, school and more.”
In Britain, there was mass protest of the introduction of digital vaccine passports in April, beside other covid protocol.
In Nigeria, the government has given the condition that citizens need to present proof of receiving coronavirus vaccine before gaining government patronage or participate in public activities organized by government.
