The acting National Leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, at the end of a meeting of Afenifere at his country home in Ogbo Ijebu, Odogbolu Local Government Area, Ogun State, stated this is the only solution that could halt the disintegration of the country. Adebanjo further told President Buhari to bury the idea of general elections in 2023 without the necessary restructuring of the country to the path of federalism. He maintained that there must first be country before elections.
“I urged President Muhammadu Buhari to bury the idea of holding an election before returning to federalism by restructuring the country now.
“There must be a country before elections are held; it would be patriotic of him to heed this advice. If Buhari is sincere about keeping the country together, he must restructure the country now; this is the only answer to halt the disintegration of the country. To save Nigeria, restructure the country now,” Adebanjo had declared.
The Afenifere leader noted that the consistent advocacy for the restructuring of the country to federalism is predicated on the founding philosophy of Afenifere.
Adebanjo acknowledged other cultural groups such as PANDEF, The Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), and Middle Belt Forum for being part of the demands and advocacy for restructuring the country for a greater and better Nigeria.
The Afenifere commended the Southern Governors Forum for endorsing the demands for restructuring, declaring support the Governors resolution at their meeting in Asaba, Delta State.
