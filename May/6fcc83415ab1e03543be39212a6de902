Share this on WhatsAppThe rivalry between Boko Haram and ISWAP climaxed Tuesday with the former killing the leader of the home-grown terrorist group also known as Jama’tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad (JAS).
A report by Eons Intelligence stated that Abubakar Shekau blew himself up to avoid been captured in the onslaught by ISWAP. Although there are reports claiming he didn’t die.
ISWAP is a deadly chip off Boko Haram, and its commander is Bana Duguri.
The fight took place inside the Sambisa forest which is the domain of Boko Haram.
However, announcing the death again of Shekau will add to the number of times the terrorist lynchpin has been announced dead, starting from the government of former President Goodluck Jonathan.
It was first announced then Shekau was killed, and foreign military allies of Nigeria confirmed the undying Shekau was a clone.
