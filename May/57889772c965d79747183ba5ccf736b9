There are emerging indications that the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, may face impeachment in the Upper Chamber of the National Assembly. Most lawmakers in the federal legislature were gathered to be dissatisfied with the leadership of Lawan in the National Assembly which they alleged is laden with ethnocentrism and regional prejudices.
A member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Sergius Ogun, on ARISE News, The Morning Show, on Monday monitored from Lagos, revealed that the process for the impeachment of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has commenced in the Nigerian National Assembly.
Hon. Ogun had noted that the move to impeach the senate president followed his attack on the 17 southern governors for their resolution on the need to restructure Nigeria.
Ogun argued that the criticism of Lawan, the number three government official in the country, of governors of a section of the country “showed that the senate president, the number three citizen, Ahmad Lawan, is not fit to occupy the position of the senate president.”
Hon. Ogun did not, however, give details of the impeachment process he said had commenced.
The federal lawmaker expressed his support for the demand for restructuring of the Nigerian polity to restore the country’s federal system.
The senate president had chided the southern governors on their resolution for restructuring, despising the governors to begin the restructuring from their states.
Meanwhile, Nigeria is currently overheated by the rising insecurity across the country.
