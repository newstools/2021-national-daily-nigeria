Governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are meeting in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Monday, one week after the meeting of the 17 southern governors at Asaba, Delta State, to deliberate on the deteriorating insecurity crisis in the country. The PDP Governors are expected to also deliberate on the party’s National Convention for the election of new party leadership scheduled between November and December.
Party sources were gathered to have disclosed that the PDP governors will deliberate further on the 12 resolutions in the communique issued by the 17 southern governors at their meeting in Asaba, Delta State, last week, which included the ban on open grazing, call on President Muhammadu Buhari to convene a national conference, and restructuring of the country.
The PDP governors have continued to reassure that the party “remains committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity,” a party source declared.
The participating governors include Governor Waziri Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Chairman of PDP Governors Forum; the host, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Governor Nnyesom Wike of Rivers State, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, among others.
Meanwhile, the resolutions at the Ibadan meeting are being awaited at the time of this report.
