Former Lagos state governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode is gradually moving up the All Progressive Congress national leader despite perceived opposition from the party’s leadership structure in his home state of Lagos.
The embattled former governor has been appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the South West subcommittee of the Contact and Strategy Committee of the All Progressives Congress, APC.
Recall that on March 23 this year, Ambode was named as a member of the Committee by the Caretaker Committee by the party’s National Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.
