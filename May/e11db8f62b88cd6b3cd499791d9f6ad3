The Nigerian Senate on Tuesday granted the request of the Chairman, Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), Danladi Umar, to be given fair hearing on the assault petition brought against him before the Senate. The embattled CCT chairman had requested for time to study the petition to enable him to prepare his response. The Seante, accordingly, gave Umar two weeks to study the details of petition, including written and video evidence on the allegation of assault against him by a legal practitioner in Abuja, Timzng Ramnap, representing his client, Clement Sargwak, a security guard at Banex Plaza, who was victim of the assault.
The Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petition, chaired by Senator Ayo Akinyelure, considered the pleadings of the CCT Chairman for fair hearing, requesting that he should be given sufficient time to study the petition and the statement of claims by the petitioner with evidence to enable him build a proper defense for himself.
Umar notified the Senate Committee that he was not served the details of the petition; saying that all he received was the invitation letter with a scanty petition, which he argued was grossly inadequate for him to defend himself.
Senator Opeyemi Bamidele – APC, Ekiti Central – and Senator James Manager – PDP, Delta South – agreed that the request of the CCT Chairman was in order; but Senator Obinna Ogba – PDP, Ebonyi – countered that the CCT chairman was not in the position to alter or determine the hearing procedures of the Senate committee. Also, Senator Albert Bassey – PDP, Akwa Ibom Northeast – aligned with Senator Ogba, arguing that it is in the position of Umar to dictate to the investigative committee.
Umar had requested for one week extension, but the senate added one more week while granting his request.
