the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State had celebrated the victory of the party’s candidate in the September 19, 2020 election in the state at the Supreme Court as a testimony of the popular will of Edo people and the endorsement of God. The party, accordingly, congratulated Governor Godwin Obaseki and the PDP teaming supporters on yet another victory.

The Edo PDP State Publicity Secretary, Chris Osa Nehikhare, in a statement declared: “it is a testimony to the fact that this government was enthroned by the wish of Edo people and had the blessings of God.
“We advised APC that it was again traveling the road of ignominy instead of joining the government to build a society where hard work is rewarded, where hate should be condemned and love for a prosperous state the driving spirit of our being. Our advice was ignored!
“With the finality of the Supreme Court judgement, we sincerely hope that APC and its leadership will be prepared to turn a new leaf of cooperation and collaboration in the building of a society where Edo People’s welfare is the watchword!
“We understand and concede that the legal route has become part and parcel of electioneering process. But do not understand nor condone how, when the people have spoken loudly and clearly through the ballot, politicians will manufacture charges in an attempt to deny the electorate their choice.”
The PDP maintained that it is now clear that Edo APC and the news and stories they propagate are built on falsehood, social greed, intellectual imbecility and pathological irresponsibility.
“We forgive them.
“After all, Governor Obaseki is a reasonable man. Edo people are reasonable people,” PDP stated.
“Governor Obaseki, we once again congratulate you and the good and patient people of Edo State as your RESETTING EDO agenda moves to the next level,” the party declared.
