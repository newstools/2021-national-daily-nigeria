The President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has been accused of aiding illegality by not inaugurating the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) board and allowing endless operation of the commission with a caretaker committee and Sole Administrator.
The Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Niger Delta Affairs, Essien Ayi, who made the allegations on Tuesday, also accused the Presidency of allowing corruption to fester within the NDDC.

Ayi’s rationale was hinged on the fact that the Federal Government was yet to institute a substantive NDDC board in order to entrench checks and balances within the commission.
Ayi, who represents Calabar-Akpabuyo-Bakassi Federal Constituency, spoke after handing over equipment for different trade and vocations to empower the last set of 130 beneficiaries in his constituency.
“The act setting up the NDDC provides for a board, chairman and managing director on a rotational basis among the states in the region. There is no provision for a caretaker committee or sole administrator and as such, running the commission without them is illegal.

“I don’t know why Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, has refused to inaugurate the NDDC board that has been screened by the National Assembly.
“Nobody is against the forensic audit and it cannot conflict with the work of a substantive board and so they cannot stop the inauguration of the board because of a forensic audit,” the lawmaker noted.
