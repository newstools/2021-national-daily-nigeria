“When criticizing sharia, we should be mindful not to be condemning it in general, as sharia in itself, is a religious instruction to Muslims, thereby making it offensive and Islamaphobic,” he said in a tweet o Friday.
He admitted Sharia is wrongly administered in Nigeria, like many other things the nation never gets right.
“However, I have always defended sharia itself due to perceived Islamaphobia which usually condemns sharia instead of its improper usage.”
According to him, nobody can impose Islam on Nigeria.
“No members of any religion should impose their religion upon others, and even Allah has commanded that ‘there is no compulsion in religion’,” he said.
The president of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria has warned about some Islamization and Fulani agenda following a proposal a group presented for amendment in the ongoing 1999 constitution review.
The Islamic Congress of Nigeria in the Wednesday proposal in Lagos urged the NASS to consider introducing Sharia to the southwest—for the Muslim population there.
