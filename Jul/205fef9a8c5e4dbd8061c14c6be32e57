Speaking to our correspondent on Wednesday in Jos, Igwe Onwudinjo fault those who said that the Southern Governors are working against the president for demanding power shift to the South.

According to him: “In 2015 when the North demanded for presidency agitating that it was their right, did anyone said they were working against former president Jonathan?.

“The demand for southern presidency is for equity and fairness. I am not a politician but I think equity demands that it should be rotated”, he said.

On the ban on open grazing, Onwudinjo reiterated that the Governors from the southern region are also just helping the country to end the incessant killings between the herders and farmers.

“Many lives have been lost as a result of farmers herders conflict, but if end to open grazing is implemented with alternative to ranching, many lives will be saved”, Onwudinjo said.
