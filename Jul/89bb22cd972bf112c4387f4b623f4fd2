His contradicts what the Lagos police command said when she was found dead in a pool of blood in a compound opposite the Yoruba nation rally venue at Ojota, lagos on July 3.
The State Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said Jumoke was abandoned after she was stabbed, and that the blood on her was dry, indicating the wound was not fresh.
But her family and witnesses said she was hit when the police opened fire on the protesters.
However, the autopsy report signed by one Dr S.S. Soyomi of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, attributed the 25-year-old’s death to “haemopericardium, disruption of the heart and lungs and missile injury to the chest.”
Last week, Lagos lawyer Femi Falana wrote the Lagos coroner for an inquest into the death of the young woman.
Reacting to the autopsy report, a lawyer with the Femi Falana Chambers, Taiwo Olawale, urged the police to identify the officer that shot the victim, and urged the state government to compensate the family.
