The Police Service Commission (PSC) has dropped the name of suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu from the list of 24 Commissioners of Police promoted to Inspectors General of Police.
This may not be unconnected with the public outcry that had earlier greeted the move by the PSC to include Magu on the list despite corruption allegations still hanging on his neck
The Commission’s Head of Press and Public Relations, Ikechukwu Ani, disclosed these in a statement on Thursday titled: ‘PSC promotes 24 CPs, 35 DCPs, 52 ACPs, 50 CSPs, drops Ibrahim Magu’.

According to him, the decisions were highpoints of the Commission’s 12th Plenary Meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday presided over by Commission’s chairman, Musiliu Smith, a retired Inspector General of Police.
He said: “The Commission declined the promotion of CP Magu pending clearance from the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of Police”.
Magu, who served as acting chairman of the EFCC from 2015 to 2020, was rejected twice by the Senate for confirmation.
