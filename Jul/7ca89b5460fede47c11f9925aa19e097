A court in Lisbon, Portugal has ruled that only 152 of verified cases died of COVID-19 as against the 17,000 claimed by the government of Portugal, noting that the rest died of various reasons not related to COVID-19.
The landmark judgment proved that the government faked COVID-19 death statistics.
According to the ruling, the number of verified COVID-19 deaths from January 2020 to April 2021 is only 152, not about 17,000 as claimed by government ministries.
The reference to 152 death certificates issued ‘under Justice Ministry supervision’ is spurious, as all death certificates are issued under Justice Ministry auspices, being the only institution that issues them.

Last year, a Portuguese appeals court ruled that PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test.
The court stated, the test’s reliability depends on the number of cycles used and the viral load present. Citing Jaafar et al. 2020, the court concludes that
“If someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the rule in most laboratories in Europe and the US), the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%.”
In Germany, it was revealed according to extensive email exchanges obtained by a group of lawyers in a legal dispute, that the German Interior Ministry hired scientists to develop a fake coronavirus model in order to justify strict lockdown.
