The Emir of Zazzau, Malam Ahmed Bamalli, has tasked media managers in the country with professionalism towards enhancing cohesion and national unity.

He made the call at his palace on Monday in Zaria during a courtesy visit by the management of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Kaduna National Station.
Bamalli decried the unprofessional conduct of some social media outlets, describing their content as potential threats to national unity.
According to the emir, security challenges being experienced in some parts of the country further buttress the need for more reliable and credible media outlets such as the FRCN.
He, therefore, urged the management of FRCN, Kaduna Zone, to sustain the tempo by releasing news, analyses, and documentaries that would further strengthen Nigeria’s unity.
Bamalli, who commended the professional conduct of reporters in Zaria, also lauded the initiative of FRCN management on the establishment of a substation, Karama FM, in Zaria.
Earlier, Alhaji Buhari Auwalu, Zonal Director, FRCN, Kaduna, who led the management team to the palace, said the visit was to congratulate Bamalli for his ascension as the 19th Emir of Zazzau.
The zonal director noted that contrary to some negative news on some social media outlets, what our leaders needed was support and prayers, hence the visit to the royal father.
Auwalu commended the Emirate Council for its support towards the establishment of Karama FM in Zaria, stressing that the plan to erect a transmitter at the substation had reached an advanced stage.
He, therefore, assured the emir of the continued support and contributions of FRCN towards taming national security challenges.
