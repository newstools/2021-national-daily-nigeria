Share this on WhatsAppDays after reports flooded the media that he formed a new party to rival the APC and the PDP in 2023, former President Olusegun Obasanjo has debunked the news, saying it was false.
According to Obasanjo, he has no plan to float a party now or later, adding he is not surprised at the news, having observed how some people are trying for months to drag him into their political games.
“In my part of the world, when you say goodnight in a place, you do not go back there and say good evening,” the former president said form Kabul, Afghanistan, where he is guesting in with President Ashraf Gani.
“The one who reported that may need to visit Yaba Left. And those who believe it can believe that their mothers are men.”
He insisted, once again, he is done with partisan politics though he’s available for seekers of his wisdom.
“With my position in Nigeria and in Africa and without being immodest and indeed in the world, my door must be opened and it is open to any individual or group of individuals who want to seek my opinion, view or advice on any issue or matter and I will respond to the best of my ability, without being part of that individual or group,” a statement by his media assistant, Kehinde Akinyemi, said on Monday.
“If anything, Chief Obasanjo’s political party today is the party of Nigerians facing insecurity, unemployment, hunger, poverty, and various other challenging issues. It is the party of Nigeria which must be saved, kept wholesomely united in peace, security, equity, development and progress.
He warned those who want to use the back door to force Obasanjo to return to partisan politics to respect his choice to remain a statesman.
