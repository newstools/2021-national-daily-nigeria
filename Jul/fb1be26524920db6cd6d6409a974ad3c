The Speaker of Edo House of Assembly, Marcus Onobun, has called on the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to beef up security in Edo, especially on the Benin-Auchi highway.

Onobun gave the charge on Monday when the new State Commandant of NSCDC, Aniekan Udoeyup, paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Benin.
He promised that the assembly would enact enabling laws that would further help tackle insecurity in the state.

He said Edo people were suffering untold hardship at the hands of kidnappers and other criminals along Benin-Auchi Road.

The speaker urged the new commandant to leverage his wealth of experience to address the insecurity on the Benin-Auchi highway.

“I want to commend the actions you have taken so far in fighting crime since assumption of office,” he said.

He further urged the commandant to work in synergy with other security agencies to make Edo a safe place in view of its strategic location.

Earlier, the Commandant said the visit was to familiarise himself with the state lawmakers.
Udoeyup said his command arrested some drug barons and oil bunkers soon after his assumption of office.

He promised to ensure regular and routine patrol on the highway and other black spots in the state.
Meanwhile, the house has received an executive bill seeking to amend the Edo State Harmonised Retirement Age of Staff of Polytechnics and Colleges of Education Law 2021.
