A barrel (159 liters) of North Sea Brent cost 76.18 dollars on Monday morning, about the same as on Friday.
The price of a barrel of the U.S. variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was also hardly changed from 75.20 dollars.
Consultations by the OPEC+ oil association go into overtime on Monday.
Before the weekend, the 23 countries had failed to agree on a common production policy.
Production should have been increased in monthly steps until the end of the year in order to meet rising demand, but a dispute between the oil power Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has prevented an agreement.
The dispute reportedly revolves around both the extent of the production increase until the end of 2021 and the extension of the conditions under which OPEC+ operates.
