“It is there very important to integrate gender dimensions into trade facilitation and logistics initiatives, especially using the spectrum AfCFTA.’’
“More importantly, ignoring the varying forms of discriminations women face in their efforts to trade and export will definitely limit the positive effects of AfCFTA in the country’s economy.’’
