Kogi state governor, Yahaya Bello has opened up on the agitations by Southern governors for zoning of 2023 presidency to the region, dismissing the call as unconstitutional.
Bello who spoke at the opening session of a two-day workshop for some selected crime and political reporters in Abuja, maintained that rotational presidency is alien to the Constitution and political parties in the country.
According to him: “The Nigeria of today deserves the best. Nigeria is a ship or a flight that requires the best captain to steer or lead the affairs of the nation to a desired destination.
“If zoning will solve our problem as at the time President Olusegun Obasanjo was the President two times, all the problems of the South should have been solved. “I will suggest that we should allow the best candidate to emerge who will unify this country? Who will solve the problems that we are facing today.

 “As at the time President Musa Yar’adua of blessed memory came on board, the whole problems of the North should have been solved. Or when it returned back to the South-south, the problems of Niger Delta should have gone.”
He added: “When we are talking of democracy, it is about free choice. And it is about the number.
“Let the majority be allowed the free will to choose who they want. Let political parties not limit Nigerians to who they want to elect into offices.
“We cannot pick and choose when it suits us. If we should continue on this sentiment of rotation of the presidency to this region or to that region, I said let us do it perfectly. In the interest of fairness, equity and justice, if that is the angle you want to come from, fine.
