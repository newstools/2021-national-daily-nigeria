The Yoruba, activist, Sunday Adeyemo, widely called Sunday Igboho, has petitioned the Federal Government, demanding compensation for damages on his residence, cars and other property by security agents. Igboho claimed that he lost over  N500 million worth of property for which he demanded compensation.
Counsel to Sunday Igboho, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), in a letter to the federal government, demanded public apology for violation of the fundamental rights of Igboho during the invasion of his house by secueity operatives, as well as institution of a probe into the action of the security officials that carried out the raid.
Counsel further cautioned all southwest Governors to “know the yearnings of their people and Igboho’s large followership to wade in before it becomes hydra headed security problems in all their domains.”
Alliyu (SAN) had said that people arrested at Igboho’s home were allegedly tortured to incriminate their principal that guns and ammunition were recovered from his residence.
Yomi Alliyu had stated: “Sunday Igboho knew that he would be arrested one day, hence retaining our services.
“He could not be that daft to keep incriminating articles in his house!
“Our client’s house is a 5-bedroom duplex with 5 chalets of 2 and 3 bedrooms. These were totally damaged with operatives allegedly arguing on whether to burn down the edifice as done to his former palatial house. The lady officer allegedly put her foot down against arson.”
