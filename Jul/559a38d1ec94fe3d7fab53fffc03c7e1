The Jos Electricity Distribution Company, (JED), has said experienced staff who are trained especially with safety protocols have all left the system accounting for the gap, lapses hitherto been experienced.

JED said to bridge this gap, training and retraining of staff will top it’s agenda as it plan to upgrade it’s facilities across it’s four franchise States of Bauchi, Gombe, Benue and Plateau.

The Managing Director of JED, Engr. Hashim Bakori, said this on Thursday, when the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN), led it’s executive on a courtesy visit to JED headquarters in Jos.

“The energy sector is having serious issues of generational gaps as experienced linesmen that knows all safety protocols and procedures have over times left the system”, Bakori said.

Calling on NAPTIN to localise it’s course contents to conform with the needs and aspirations of the Energy Sector, JED
appealed to the institute to schedule some needed special training programmes for the company, adding that the focus of the training should be in the areas of installation of meters, revenue protection, training of linesmen as well as the technical subsect of the company.

“We have young men that were just hired on the street who learnt it by seeing others do the work without knowing the basics, specifically on handling overhead line materials.

“Our marketers lack requisite knowledge of the technicalities in meter bypass or breach of network, cable jointers amongst others”, Bakori laments.

Responding, NAPTIN Director General, Ahmed Nagode said the visit was aimed at exploring ways of collaboration, which he said training is one of it’s core mandate that JED staff will benefit.

The visit was communicated to our correspondent in a statement sent by the Electricity Company’s Spokesman, Dr. Friday Elijah.
