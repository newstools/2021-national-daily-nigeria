He has been restored as APGA candidate by a High Court in Anambra State.
The presiding judge of Awka Hight Court 2, Justice Charles Okay, on Monday  reinstated Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo as the authentic candidate of the APGA for the November 6, 2021 Anambra State Governorship Election.
INEC had in the list of the names of candidates and their political parties for the November 6 Anambra Governorship election last week, excluded Professor Charles Soludo, former CBN Governor and the candidate of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP).
INEC had, however, included the name of the governorship candidate of the Okeke-led APGA, Umeh Orji, and his running mate, in response to a court order.
INEC also included Andy Uba and his running mate, candidate of the APC, on the list of governorship candidates for the November 6 election.
According to the INEC list, there was no candidate for the PDP in the November 6 Anambra governorship election as a result of a court order restraining the party’s primary elections.
