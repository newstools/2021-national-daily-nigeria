Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan Kukah has revealed what he perceived as a Fulani agenda for Nigeria beginning with the Northern part of the country where thousands of Christians have either been killed or displaced from their ancestral lands.
Bishop Kukah who disclosed this when he appeared before the US Congress in Washington, DC to testify to the persecution of Christians in Nigeria, said every outlet in Christian communities in the Northern part of the country has been Islamized.
“Under President Buhari, the country is falling apart. We have never been this divided,” Bishop Kukah told the US Congress during his testimony on Tuesday, July 13.

He lamented that things are unravelling under the watch of President Mummadu Buhari, saying that his government is either helpless or unconcerned and nepotistic.
He condemned as a totally misplaced priority, the $2 billion railway line to neighbouring Niger Republic being built by the Buhari administration, saying: “Buhari is spending billions of dollars on a railway to another country when his own people can’t feed.”
Reacting, some US Congress members aligned themselves with Bishop Kukah’s testimony .
Congressman Chris Smith spoke of the “threat to Nigeria of Fulani ethno-religious supremacists,” alleging that Buhari has filled so many top positions with Fulanis.
On her part, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee said: “I’m not happy with President Buhari. I represent the most Nigerian Americans in American – Houston. I studied in Nigeria and studied in Lagos.”
“I will be meeting with Nigeria advocates in the coming weeks,” she added.
