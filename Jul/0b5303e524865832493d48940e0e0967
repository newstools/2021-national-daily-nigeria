Otherwise, his forgery offence will be considered, and prosecutors will take over.
A report by the BBC Pidgin stated this before the court hearing was underway, with Adeyemo, aka Igboho and his German wife Ropo in a Cotoniu court of appeal.
A judicial source confirmed to BBC Pidgin that Igboho and his wife, Ropo were interrogated by operatives of Brigade criminelle in Cotonou.
Igboho’s lawyers have been running around since his arrest Monday night.
But their efforts—to get Germany involved, block the extradition, and secure his release—didn’t yield much.
His lawyers complained he was I chain and pain in detention.
Their rhetoric seems to have changed—to prayer for a fair extradition trial—from their initial combatant demand of Benin releasing him because he’s only a freedom fighter.
