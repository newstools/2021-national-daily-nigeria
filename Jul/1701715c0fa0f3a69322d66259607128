The Military Taskforce Commander in Plateau State Maj. General Ibrahim Ali has said grazing of cattle must end by 6pm daily.

Gen. Ali who is the new Operation Safe Haven Commander OPSH said anyone caught flouting the order will be dealt with.

The OPSH boss gave the warning during a meeting with stakeholders from Riyom LGA of the State.


“All grazing must end by 6pm, anyone caught violating this directive would be dealt with.
“Night grazing must stop”, he said.
Speaking during the meeting, Gen. Ali who doubles as the Commanding Officer, 3 Division, warned both herders and farmers against taking law into their hands, requesting that whatever happened to any member of a community should be reported to the personnel of the operation deployed to their areas, or any appropriate authority, assuring that the OPSH under his watch would do everything possible to ensure justice and fairness to everyone.


He said, “The work is not easy but it is possible. Attacks and counter attacks must be stopped. No herder should rear cows on any farm crops. Any herder caught rearing or destroying farm crops will be delt with.

“Again, no farmer should kill cows. If cows eat your crops, reports to us. All complaints should be reported to the appropriate authorities before taking any action.


“Also, those who rustle cows should henceforth stop because we will come after them.”
He also urged community leaders to desist from shielding criminals in their domain.
