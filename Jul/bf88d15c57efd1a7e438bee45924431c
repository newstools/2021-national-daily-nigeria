Lawan spoke following the laying of the report on the Bill by the Chairman, Senate Committee on the Independent National Electoral Commission, Senator Kabiru Gaya (Kano South) at plenary.
The federal lawmakers were said to have spiked the clause on electronic transmission.
According to Lawan, following the publication of his phone number and that of the Speaker, Femi Gbajabimila on social media, he received over 900 short messages (SMS) on his phone in one day.
“There are various accusations, insinuations that the leadership of the Senate or leadership of the National Assembly has tempered with the report of the committee on INEC of both chambers,” he said.
“Some of those accusing the leadership of the National Assembly are misinformed and innocent. Some are simply mischievous and rabble-rousers.
“This is the first time this report is laid here and this is the report of the committee. This is the decision of the committee on INEC and therefore whatever will be discussed or considered about the bill, will be on the basis of what has been presented to the Senate here.
“If anybody feels very strongly about anything, lobby the distinguished senators to canvass for your positions, rather than blackmail our leadership.
“We will do what is right. We have our procedures. And lobbying is part of democracy.”
The bill will go through clause by clause hearing July 15 at a joint session of the both chambers.
The contentious section—on electronic transfer—will be left for INEC to decide.
