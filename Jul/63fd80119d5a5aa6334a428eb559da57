Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State may be ridiculing President Muhammadu Buhari in disguise on the establishment of ranching for herdsmen. The Benue governor is, accordingly, demanding the sum of N100 billion from the federal government to Benue State for the establishment of ranching. Governor Ortom argued that since the federal government approved N6.5 billion to Katsina State for establishment of ranching for herdsmen, Benue State deserves much more with an apology.
Governor Ortom, in Makurdi, protested that it is hypocritic that the federal government approved N6.5 billion for Katsina State for the establishment of ranching. He argued that the approval contradicts the earlier decision of the federal government to sustain open grazing.
Governor Ortom had declared: “It is hypocrisy for the federal government to approve money for ranching in a state and leave others out. And in fact, the Governor of the (Katsina) state in his remark said N5 billion had already been remitted to their coffers. So, I begin to wonder, where are we headed.
“Tell me where we are economically, security-wise, politically, where is Nigeria?
“So, when I hear people say that they are decamping from one political party to the APC, one wonders what they are going there to do.
“A government that has failed completely in all spheres of life.
“Even you, the journalists who are talking to me, can you, in all honesty, say this government of APC and the presidency have impacted your lives?
“So, we must not be afraid to speak out.”
