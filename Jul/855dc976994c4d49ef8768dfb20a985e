Buhari just appointed the professor as part of the 43 chairmen of university governing councils recently constituted.
And the political scientist has yet to spurn the appointment.
For a pointy critics of the current administration, Jega, many expect, ought to turn down the gig.
Jega noted then something fundamentally wrong with the president. Ho has wasted a lot of time doing little.
“He still has time to correct things if he has the capacity to do that,’ he said.
“Many people wish him well but are worried about the direction the country is taking.”
Many see Jega’s appointment as chairman, Governing Council, University of Jos, as golden handcuffs.
However, it may appear too early to hear him accept the offer.
