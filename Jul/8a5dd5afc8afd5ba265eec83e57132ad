Initiative for Leadership Development and Change (ILDC), a Non-Governmental Organisation, on Tuesday commiserated with Mr. David Ojei, Proprietor of Prince Ebeano Supermarket and traders whose shops were gutted by fire.

The National Daily reports that the popular Prince Ebeano Supermarket at Lokogoma district in Abuja was razed by fire late on Sunday, July 18.
Mr. Frank Ebere-Njoku, the Deputy National Coordinator, ILDC who commiserated with victims on behalf of the group, said in Abuja that the fire incident was tragic.
Ebere-Njoku urged the proprietor of the supermarket and traders to take solace in God over the millions of naira worth of property lost in the inferno.
“I console everyone affected by the fire especially, Mr. David Ojei and other traders and I pray God to grant them the fortitude to bear the loss.
“It is surprising that the cause of the fire is still not ascertained but however, I urged all who lost one thing or the other to move on with faith and hope,” he said.
The ILDC Deputy Coordinator said the inferno was a big blow on the economy.
According to him, the inferno is capable of rendering some people jobless owing to the degree of damages done.
Ebere-Njoku who described the Ebeano Supermarket market as an economic hub in Abuja said the proprietor is a selfless and patriotic Nigerian.
He also congratulated Muslims on the celebration of the Eid-el-Kabir, urging them to be safety conscious in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.
