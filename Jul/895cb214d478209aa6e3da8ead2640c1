Oyetunji said that Aug. 9 would be for Iboriade, a unique assemblage, and display of crowns of the past Ataojas of Osogbo, for blessings.
The Ataoja of Osogbo explained that he would lead the event as the sitting Ataoja, in conjunction with the Arugba, Yeye Osun, and a committee of priestesses.
According to him, Aug. 13 will witness the grand finale, the sacrificial offering by Arugba at the Osun Osogbo Sacred Grove inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.
“Other activities of the festival, which are adjudged as of immense benefit to the tourism sector in Nigeria, include Ifa Arugba, Orun Odo, Ajigun, Ifa Agbalu, and Ifa Dida.
“The Osun Osogbo Festival is the biggest annual religious festival among the Yoruba people and serves as a strong unifying factor for indigenes of Osogboland.”
He said that the annual festival brings everyone together, irrespective of their different social, economic, religious, and political convictions.
“During this year’s edition, local and international worshippers, devotees, spectators, and tourists will observe all COVID-19 protocols as was done during the 2020 edition,” he added.
