He also revealed that the chances of Bola Tinubu, a national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), becoming the next president of Nigeria in 2023 are unlikely.
According to the cleric, any attempt by the APC leader to contest for president will be a disaster.
“Tinubu should keep off politics and watch his health and take care of his family. Most of the problems in APC today is been orchestrated by Tinubu.
“Tinubu presidency will run into shambles… because God did not send Tinubu to rule Nigeria.”
He also disclosed that: “The next president of Nigeria is not yet known. Atiku cannot rule this country, he should go and sleep, El-rufai can’t rule this country.
“Igbo should produce the next president, but they are their own problem, so they should forget about the presidency in 2023.”
