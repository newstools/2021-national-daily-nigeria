The defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) may have turned a political turbulent incident for Governor Bello Matawalle  of Zamfara State in several respects.  on Tuesday officially defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Zamfara governor may be incurring the wrath of the God he serves for defying the oath he made in 2019 after becoming a governor on the platform of the PDP courtesy of the Supreme Court’s judgement.
Governor Matawalle had in 2019 vowed that he would not leave the PDP, taking an oath in the name of the God he serves to punish him if he dumps the party.
A report by SaharaReporters indicated that Governor Matawalle in a video had declared, speaking in Hausa language: “If I ever betray PDP, may I not live in peace for the rest of my life, I swear by Allah.
“If I can leave PDP or cheat any of our members, may Allah punish me.”
Perhaps, having forgotten his oath, the governor early this week defected to APC in a special grand rally for his reception, organised by the APC National Caretaker Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State.
Matawalle on his defection declared: “As from today, I, Bello Matawalle Maradun, Governor of Zamfara, I am happy to announce my defection from the PDP to the APC. As from today, I am a full APC member and leader of APC in Zamfara.
“I am calling on all APC stakeholders in the state to join hands with me to build the party and move the state forward.”
This is sheer reminiscence of the governor’s renege on his oath, amidst other controversies surrounding his defection to the APC. The people of the state do not appear to be with the governor on his defection to APC. The supernatural may not be feeling different for the defiance of the binding oath.
