Former Kaduna Central Senator, Shehu Sani, has reacted to reports that bandits shut down an Alpha jet of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), noting that with that act, Bandits in the North have taken the war to a new level.
Recall that there was confusion over the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha jet that flew out of base for an assault on Sunday and was shut down.
The fighter plane routinely conducts air raids on the Kaduna-Katsina-Zamfara corridor.
Late Sunday and Monday morning, sources close to the military said there was indeed an “incident” but that the pilot survived, according to the information available to them.
The operation followed the alert by locals to security personnel that scores of criminals in vehicles and motorcycles were gathering.
Sani said the attack of a NAF jet was an indication that bandits have taken the war to a new level.
He tweeted:  “The capacity of bandits in the North to threaten Aviation takes the war to a new level.
