The Biafra Nations League (BNL) has ridiculed Joe Igbokwe, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, to visit the southeast if he believes he is influential.
The National Leader of the BNL, Princewill Chimezie Richards, challenged Joe Igbokwe to visit the southeast where, he said, Igbo youths are waiting to tear him to pieces.
Princewill Chimezie Richards mocked Igbokwe “as an aid to Governor Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Public Latrine and Sewage Disposal”. He vowed that Igbokwe will never cross to the southeast in his lifetime, saying that Igbo youths will stone him to death for sabotage.
Joe Igbokwe has become renowned for his anti-Igbo statements in exchange for the promotion of the political principal that brought him to public cognition and wealth. The Igbo nation often feel betrayed and sabotaged by every word that comes out of Joe Igbokwe on the Igbo affairs. Igbokwe is conceived to have developed cynical hatred for the Igbo nation which the people also return to him in good measures.

“First of all, he is not ashamed that for years he can’t attend public functions in Igbo land; he doesn’t visit home; he feels he is occupying a good office in Lagos; for that, he is always defending whatever the APC government does.
“But he doesn’t know he is just a mere SA on Public Latrine and Sewage Disposal,” Princewill Chimezie Richards had said.
The BNL Leader cautioned Igbokwe on the consequences awaiting him if he moves from  Lagos into the southeast to fight Biafra supporters. He warned Igbokwe that he can only sabotage the Igbo cause in Lagos and Abuja but dare not step into any part of the southeast.
