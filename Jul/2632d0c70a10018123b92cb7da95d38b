Share this on WhatsAppThe power struggle between the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed and Governor Abdurahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara state has taken a new twist following the declaration of support for the governor by three senators representing the state.
It would be recalled that the once good relationship between both politicians became frosty when Lai Mohammed a few days ago accused Governor AbdulRazaq of biting the fingers that fed him, citing how he single handedly sponsored the governor’s election in 2019.
Mr Mohammed, who hails from Kwara South, said this on Saturday in Ilorin at the inauguration of a new state secretariat of the party.

The minister and some other pivotal members of the APC that played a major role in the ousting of the Saraki hegemony in the state have accused Governor AbdulRazaq of sidelining them in his administration of the state.
The governor, on the other hand, said he would not use state resources to reward party loyalty as allegedly expected by some APC members.
On Wednesday, the three senators, Ibrahim Oloriegbe (Kwara Central), Lola Ashiru (Kwara South) and Umar Sadiq (Kwara North), while addressing journalists in Abuja declared their total support for Governor Abdulrazaq, describing him as the authentic leader of the All Progressives Congress in the state.

They clarified that all the money realised by the APC in the state to prosecute the 2019 elections were judiciously utilised under the leadership of the governor.
The senators said the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed was not speaking the minds of the party members when he said Kwara State, under the current administration, had “entered one-chance.”
The lawmakers also explained that the revalidation of membership registration would soon start to enable those who had yet to register to do so before the state party’s congress.
