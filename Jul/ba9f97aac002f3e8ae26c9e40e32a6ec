The Biafra Nations League (BNL) has threatened to sabotage maritime security of Nigeria and Cameroon in the Bakassi Peninsula. The group cautioned the Nigerian government to handle the case of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, with utmost care. The BNL Chief of Staff and front line Bakassi Youth Leader, Linus Asuquo Essien, had in a statement warned that the group would sabotage Cameroon and Nigeria maritime security in Bakassi, ensuring devastating effects on the economy and security of both countries.
The BNL Chief of Staff threatened that Militias in Bakassi loyal to the BNL would soon start intercepting vessels and apprehending all crew members onboard like they did in 2016/2017, in response to the renewed alliance between the Nigerian government and Cameroon in Abuja.
The group berated President Paul Biya of Cameroon who through the country’s special envoy in Abuja, commended the Nigerian government for the rearrest of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader.
