Nura listed the services included vital science, health education, distribution of blankets and insecticides, treatment of common ailments, and HIV/AIDS counseling among others.
He said the medical outreach was part of the army’s corporate social responsibility towards enhancing civil-military relations.
The Commandant said other events lined up for the week included special prayer sessions for the fallen heroes.
He urged well-meaning Nigerians to support the army and other sister agencies in the fight against criminality as well as protection of lives and property.
“I request all of us to be our brothers’ keepers. We should desist from negative narrations capable of disrupting our peaceful coexistence.
“I assure you that the Nigerian Army will continue to maintain peace, order, and protect the territorial integrity of the country,” he said.
