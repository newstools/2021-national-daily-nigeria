Cautions against undermining Deputy Gov Aliyu Gusau

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alerted banks and other financial institutions in Zamfara State on alleged plans for unapproved financial transactions by Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State. The party enjoined to finance managers to watch out for a purported sweeping of Zamfara State treasury.
PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbodiyan, indicated its vehement opposition to an alleged plot by Governor Matawalle to undermine the office of the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State for refusal of Deputy Governor Aliyu Gusau, to join Governor Matawalle to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
The PDP argued that the mandate of the party is not transferable to the APC, adding that the police, including all other security agencies in the State are placed on notice on the emerging threats.
The PDP cited Section 221 of the 1999 Constitution as amended, as well as the judgement of the Supreme Court in Falake vs INEC 2016 in its arguments.
The party, therefore, declared its support for the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, vowing to deploy all political resources at the behest of the party to defend the deputy governor in any political attacks from the Zamfara governor.
