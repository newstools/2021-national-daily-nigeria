But the tidings his lawyer Alloy Ejimakor brought after hours of meeting on the weekend with the detained Kanu , who calls Nigeria a zoo that should be balkanized, is cheery—if conflicting,
According to Ejimakor, Kanu stressed the importance of unity and tolerance on all sides.
“Today, I met with Onyendu at the DSS. We spent nearly four hours. My interaction with him was fulfilling,” he said
“He’s cheery and looks forward to overcoming this predicament sooner than later. Again, he stressed UNITY and tolerance on all sides. He has you all in his thoughts,” he tweeted.
A video surfaced followig his arrest, showing Kanu preaching unity in London in 2012, urging the federal government to do something specifically about the insecurity plaguing the north then.
Kanu jumped bail in 2017 while facing trial for terrorism and treason, and his outlawed group has been unleashing terror on government, INEC, and security installation in their secessionist quest for Biafra Republic.
He’s been in the DSS custody since his repatriation to Nigeria through international cooperation by security and intelligence agencies.
Kanu however insisted Kenya facilitated his abduction.
