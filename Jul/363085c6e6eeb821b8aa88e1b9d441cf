Guinea will not take part in the Tokyo Olympic Games, the countryâ€™s sports ministry announced late Wednesday.
The West African country cited the increasing number of coronavirus infections and concerns about the health of athletes as the reasons behind their decision.
The delegation would have consisted of five athletes.
Guinea is the second country to decide not to send any athlete to Tokyo.
North Korea is the first, even though its decision could have been politically motivated.
The National Daily reports that the Olympic Games are due to officially open on Friday in Tokyo, Japan with the opening ceremony.
