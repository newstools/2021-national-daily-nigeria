Popular activist, Deji Adeyanju has accused the department of state services of planting guns inside Sunday Igboho’s house during their raid yesterday.
It would be recalled that the DSS claimed that they saw guns, fire arms, bullets in Sunday Igboho’s house during the raid, and declared him wanted for being in possession of those materials.
Deji Adeyanju made it known that Sunday Igboho should be thankful that they didn’t plant bombs in his house, stating that the officers killed two people and acted like they didn’t commit any crime.
Igboho should be thanking God that it is only guns they planted in his house and not bombs. This hopeless Govt killed 2 people in Igboho’s house & they are acting like they didn’t commit any crime today.
