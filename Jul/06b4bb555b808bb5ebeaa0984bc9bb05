It was an implied one, though, and an open secret.
According to a former National Chairman of the Congress for Progressive Change, CPC, Rufai Hanga, even in law, there is an epressed and implied act.
“If something is expressed, there are no two ways about it,” Hanga said in an interview with the Daily Trust.
“There was an implied agreement that he would take over. That is why he didn’t back out after the first tenure.
“If Tinubu knew that he would not benefit, he would have backed out during Buhari’s first tenure. But he knows there was an agreement.”

Other parties were ACN and ANPP.
