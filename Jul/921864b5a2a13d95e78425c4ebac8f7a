The EU has commenced enforcement of its Digital Covid Certificate – the vaccine “passport” in all 27 member states.
The introduction of vaccine certificate precipitated wide protests in the United Kingdom (UK).
It was highlighted that the Digital Covid Certificate is proof of the evidence that EU citizens in the 27 member states have:-

been vaccinated against Covid-19
recently had a negative PCR test for the virus
recently recovered from Covid-19

The coronavirus vaccine certificate beside the 27 EU member states, is extended to Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
It was disclosed that the vaccine passport is free, and accessible to all EU citizens, and non-EU nationals legally residing or living in the EU member states (with the right to travel to other member states) for download or obtain a paper copy.
The vaccine certificate was officially introduced on 1 July with a six-week phase-in period; while the controversies rage on.
