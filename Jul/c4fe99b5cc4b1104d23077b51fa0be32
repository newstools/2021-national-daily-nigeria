Winner of the Chairmanship primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Amuwo Odofin Local Government area of Lagos State during the party’s primary election, which held on May 29th, Hon. Dipo Olorunrinu as contained in the list duly signed and published in the Nation Newspaper of June 4, 2021 by the party, has sued the party and individuals who allegedly subverted the people’s will to court.

A suit filed at the Lagos High Court with Reference number 593302021, revealed that those sued included the National arm of the APC, Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC), and APC Caretaker Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee.

Others are Chairman of the Lagos APC caretaker committee, Hon. Tunde Balogun and the incumbent Chairman of Amuwo Odofin Local Government,  Hon. Valentine Buraimoh.


Olorunrinu claimed that his name was later substituted with that of Braimoh after it had been published by the party in national newspapers and when he had filled LASIEC nomination form.

He is however urging the court to ensure that his mandate is returned by the leadership of the party.


It was reliably gathered that some of the persons sued by the politician have been evading court summon before it was eventually served on them on Friday 2nd  July, 2021.

The affected persons are expected to appear in court on Wednesday July 7, when hearing will commence.
