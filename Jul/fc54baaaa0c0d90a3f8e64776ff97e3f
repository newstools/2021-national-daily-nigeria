He told BBC News Pidgin in an interview monitored by The Nation that the rally in Lagos has been suspended.
Igboho has held rallies across the six states of the southwest, urging supporters to demand secession of Yoruba form the union.
His group, the Ilana Omo Oodua, is headed by historian Prof. Banji Akintoye whom political leaders in the region have discreditedâ€”along with his secessionist campaign.
The Lagos rally was supposed to be the biggest and the final, and the chances of confrontation with the police are high.
Igboho has yet to connect the cancellation with the brutal attack on his home.
