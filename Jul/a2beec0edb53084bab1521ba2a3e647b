Senators voting record

The endorsement of the controversial amended Electoral Act has continued to generate apprehension across the country over the transparency and credibility of election results without the use of electronic instruments. There have been concerns that senators elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) voted unanimously to kill the clause that stipulate ‘electronic transmission of results’ in elections in Nigeria, which many stakeholders in the country consider as anti-democratic law. How the senators voted has become public knowledge.
A list of how the senators voted on the retention of electronic voting in the amended electoral act at the Thursday sitting indicated that of the 80 total votes 28 senators voted YES, while 52 senators voted NO; and
28 senators were absent.
