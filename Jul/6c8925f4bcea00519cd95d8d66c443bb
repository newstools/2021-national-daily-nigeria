But some of his right-hand boys have said no.
Olayomi Koiki, his Facebook handler, has claimed the higher-ups have over-ridden the order. The founder of the Ilana Omo Oodua Prof Banji Akintoye, too, has insisted no going back. Likewise the group secretary George Akinola.
If the elite cell of the group ever intend to lead the protest July 3, the federal government who now speaks the ‘language they understand’ has got a plan for them.
“We pray they come out,” a security source told the Daily Post.
“I can confirm to you that those of them who had instigated violence or made seditious comments will be arrested and prosecuted.”
The source said some of them are wanted already following the Thursday incident.
“So this will be a good time to apprehend them. The opportunity has presented itself.”
In Lagos already, the police command has deployed a scare tactic.
The National Daily earlier reported how hundreds of armed police have taken over the Freedom Park, Ojota, with APC and other security assets—in readiness for those who will defy both Igboho and CP Hakeem Odumosu’s orders.
