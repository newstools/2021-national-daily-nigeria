INEC has excluded his name from the list of candidates the commission clear for the guber contest in November. It did same thing to the PDP candidate Valentine Ozigbo.
INEC, in a statement by Festus Okoye, its National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, cited Court Order for the exclusion of Ozigbo.
But INEC cleared the candidate of the other APGA faction, Chukwuma Micheal Umeoji, for the governorship election.
The former CBN governor has been passed over several time since he began looking for political office in 2007. He got as far as winning the APGA ruling party ticket in Gov Willie Obiano’s faction.
But the professor has insisted he will contest the Nov. 6 election despite the INEC disqualification.
