Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Monday condoled with the Fasasi family and the Nigerian entertainment industry on the death of Olanrewaju Fasasi, popularly known as Sound Sultan.

Sound Sultan, a renowned rapper, singer, and songwriter died on Sunday at age 44 and was buried in the U.S. in accordance with Islamic injunctions.
Sanwo-Olu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, expressed shock over the death of the singer.
He said  Fasasi’s demise was painful and a great loss to the deceased family, the Nigerian music industry, and the country as a whole.
The governor urged the deceased family, friends, associates, fans, and entertainment practitioners to take the death of Sound Sultan as an act of God.
”Sound Sultan’s death is painful. He was a bundle of talent who used his God-given gift to advance the course of mankind. His music, artistry, and interest in sports were all donated at every point for the development of humanity.
”No doubt, the death of a loved one is usually painful because it is irreparable but we must always take solace in God,  especially if the deceased had lived a good and fulfilled life, just like the late Olanrewaju Fasasi.
”He was a celebrated singer, comedian, rapper, songwriter, and actor during his lifetime,” he said.
Sanwo-Olu said that Sound Sultan would be missed by his family, friends, fans, and the Nigerian entertainment industry, as one of the pacesetters of modern hip hop music in Nigeria.
He said the musician was notable for using his music to speak against poverty, corruption, bad governance, and societal ills in Nigeria.
The governor said his death had left a vacuum that would take some time to be filled.
”I sympathize with Sound Sultan’s widow, children, siblings, family, fans, and colleagues.
”I pray that God will grant the late Olanrewaju Fasasi eternal rest and grant the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” he said.
