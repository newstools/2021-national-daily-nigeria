President Muhammadu Buhari has lauded Executive Director of Nigerian Export Promotion Council, Mr. Olusegun Awolowo, on his election as President of National Trade Promotion Organizations (TPOs) from the ECOWAS Member States.
The president, in a statement by his spokesman, Mr. Femi Adesina, believed Awolowoâ€™s unanimous election was a testament to the confidence reposed in him, and in Nigeria, by Chief Executive Officers of TPOs in West Africa.
He urged Awolowo to serve to the best of his ability, and do the country proud.
Buhari noted that an ECOWAS TPO Network holds great possibilities for Nigeria and the sub-region in the areas of exchange of commercial information and business opportunities.
He expressed the hope that the domiciling of the Secretariat in Abuja would open vistas of opportunities for Nigeria.
The president wished Awolowo well in his new assignment, expressing confidence that Nigeria and ECOWAS would benefit a lot from his expertise in trade promotions.
