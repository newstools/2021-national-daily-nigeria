The Court D’Appeal in Cotonou adjourned the case involving the Igboho till Friday, July 23, 2021.
Three weeks after he was declared wanted by Nigeria’s secret police, the Republican Police on Monday evening arrested Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho.
Igboho, a campaigner for Yoruba self-determination, was arrested in neighbouring Cotonou, Benin Republic, while trying to travel to Germany.

It was learnt that under the agreements between the two countries, Mr Igboho’s extradition should be concluded without hindrance.
A sociocultural group in Oyo State, The Landmark Group, in a statement by its chairman, Ayo Adekunle, accused the federal government of trying to victimise and dehumanise Igboho.
“It’s astonishing that the charges against our brother are neither of killing, kidnapping or abduction which are the thriving businesses in Nigeria today and need the concerted efforts of the government working with the state and local government. However, with the kind of treatment and selective manhunt for our brother, such collaborative efforts may be an exercise in futility.
