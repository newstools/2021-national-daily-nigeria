Accordingly, Soludo would be pairing with Dr. Onyeka Ibezim, a Medical Doctor and the Managing Director of Anambra State Oxygen Production Plant, Chairman Anambra State Action Committee on HIV/AIDS and Special Adviser to the Governor on Traditional Medicine.
Dr. Onyeka Ibezim was identified as the younger brother of Alexander Ibezim, the Archbishop Province of the Niger, and Bishop of Awka Diocese of the Anglican Communion.
The choice of Soludo has drawn a demarcation line between the Anglican and Catholic dominions in Anambra State.
