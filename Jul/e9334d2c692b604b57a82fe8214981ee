Austrian Foreign Minister, Alexander Schallenberg on Monday said European Union (EU) must respond to Belarus, Afghanistan, and Turkey’s attempt to use migrants as a weapon against the bloc.
The minister said he has been aware of reports of Afghanistan’s intention to suspend deportations for three months.
He said that it absolutely unacceptable given the agreements between the country and the EU.
“I think that we, as the European Union, need to slowly take into account that more and more countries intend to use migration as a weapon against us.
“I think that the European Commission and the EU need to wake up so that we can start using all the opportunities at our disposal.
“Whether in the financial area, in the area of political development, or in trade, we cannot just tolerate the way other countries want to use migration as a weapon against the EU and is a pressure on EU, ” he said.
