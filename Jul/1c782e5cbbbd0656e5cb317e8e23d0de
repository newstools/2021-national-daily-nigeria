Share this on WhatsAppEdo Gov Godwin Obaseki and the federal government’s moves to take over the soon- to-be-repatriated Benin arts—from Germany—might be up to a rough start.
Obaseki is proposing the Edo Museum of West Africa Arts to receive and keep the works of arts the West looted from the Benin kingdom in the 18 century, sold to German collectors who eventually treasured the artifacts in German museums.
But spiritual and cultural organisations in Benin consider the governor intercepting the ancient works robbing the ancient  Benin royal house, its council of chiefs, and the Benin people of their heritage
The African Ancestral Spiritual Ministry (Great Queen Idia Eye’s) is now at the forefront of the opposition to the official robbery.
“The Benin royal artefacts in concern are spiritual, traditional and cultural assets of Ancient Benin Heritage where His Royal Majesty Ọmọ N’oba N’Edo Uku akpolokpolor Ọba Ewuare II is the oba,” said Nosa Duke Uwagboe in a petition on behalf of the AASM.
“Oba of Benin is the sole paramount ruler and custodian of Benin tradition, culture, and also the spiritual leader of Edo people.”
Obaseki is planning to start a museum that will accommodate those artifacts —just to impress the German government whose plan for the repatriation of the works includes funding.
The group also alleged an NGO, the “Legacy Restoration Trust, has been floated for this, and it is now linked to Obaseki. This has equally raised doubt about the transparency of the governor’s move.
This NGO serves as a proxy to promote the interest of Obaseki in matters relating to the artefacts, the group said.
“We believe that the lack of transparency in this process by the government of Edo state, the federal government of Nigeria and their affiliated organizations is a big cause for concern.”
