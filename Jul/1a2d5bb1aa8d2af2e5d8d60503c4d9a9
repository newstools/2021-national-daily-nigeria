In spite of several appeals by well-meaning Nigerians and South-South lawmakers for the Senate to reconsider allocation to host communities in the controversial Petroleum Industry Bill, the Senate on Thursday insisted on 3%.
The members of the upper legislative chamber adopted the report of the conference committee that recommended 3% as against the views of the southern lawmakers who had demanded 5% for host communities.
The number in dispute is the percentage of the total operating expenses (OPEX) that oil companies are expected to contribute to a trust fund created for host communities. On Thursday, two southern senators George Sekibo and Seriake Dickson raised concerns over the approval.
Senator Sekibo said he is not part of the vote on the allocation clause and Senator Dickson said his privilege had been breached as his views were not accommodated.
However, Senate President Ahmad Lawan replied that the Senate had taken a resolution on the matter and could not go back on its decision.
