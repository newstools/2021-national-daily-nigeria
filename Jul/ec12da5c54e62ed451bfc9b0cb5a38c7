The judgement was delivered Friday.
The rights organization brought the suit against Nigeria on behalf of Agba Jalingo, a journalist arrested in Lagos and torture in the lead-up to Revolution Now rally in 2019.
He was released Feb 2020, and then charged with treasonable felony, terrorism, cultism, and attempt to overthrow Cross River Gov. Ben Ayade and President Buhari.
The journalist had a run-in with Ayade over a report on N500m allegedly meant for the Cross River Micro Finance Bank.
The governor then ordered his arrest, and the police arrested him in Lagos, from where they bundled him to Cross River.
Jalingo claimed he was blindfolded, and handcuffed to a fridge while the police transported him to the state.
