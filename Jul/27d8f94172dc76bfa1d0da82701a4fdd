Elders in Benue State has warned Joe Ibokwe not to toy with the name of their Governor, Samuel Ortom, who they said is far too advanced in wisdom and politics to join issues with him.
 
The elders who spoke through one of their representative, Elder Tyokegh Peter, warned Ibokwe to restrict his thuggery to Lagos and the APC which he is so obsessed in protecting.
 
Recall Ibokwe was quoted to have said “Thank God that Ortom isn’t telling us it is Fulani Herdsmen”, a statement he made while reacting to the news of 30 houses razed during a communal clash in Benue State.
 
Responding, Elder Peter who is also a staunch politician said Ibokwe is always talking to please his pay masters.
 
Peter reminded him that Governor Ortom is a man God sent to salvage the people of Benue State an assignment which the Governor has carried out judiciously.
 
According to him: “Ortom contested for governor in 2015, first under PDP, very close to the elections there was a gang- up against him and he defected to APC unpopular party in Benue and won the elections.
 
“Ortom’s interest has been to serve the people of benue who were under continuous attack by Fulani terrorists and he took the bull by the horn, despite his affiliation with the APC he boldly implemented Anti Grazing Law.
 
“This led to a failed impeachment plot against him and all manner of attacks ensued to make Benue State ungovernable for him.
 
“Ortom defected back to PDP and still won elections in 2019 amidst overwhelming rigging by APC. God gave Ortom victory even with 14 commissioners of police in Benue State on a special mission, he won in the supreme court.
 
“Joe Buhari Igbokwe, watch before your greed consumes you. You can’t fight Ortom and succeed”, elder Peter said.
