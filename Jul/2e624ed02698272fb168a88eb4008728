The federal and state governments have borrowed at least N107.1 billion from Nigerian banks in the first five months of this year to make up for revenue shortfalls.
This number was derived using Central Bank of Nigeria data on money credit to the economy from December of last year to May 2021.
The new borrowings during this period have pushed the total government’s debt to the banking sector to N12.5 trillion compared to N12.4 trillion it stood at as at December 2020.
When compared to N956 billion in May 2020 it also indicates a 30.8 percent increase.
