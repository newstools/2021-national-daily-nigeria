The court stated the reason it authorised the arrest of the former General Manager of Radio Bayelsa, John Idumange.
Justice Iniekenimi Uzakah issued the warrant, following an oral application by State Prosecuting Counsel E.S. Obed who noted that Idumange has been absent from court to defend the charge against him.
The Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice in Bayelsa, Biriyai Sambo, SAN, sued Idumange for misdemeanor and seditious publications against government officials, who Idumange accused of diverting the loan.
The Defence Counsel, , J.D Olubowale had told the court that the defendant had an accident on his way to court but the judge insisted that the defendant must be produced in court and adjourned till July 26.
A Magistrates’ Court had on March 11 in Yenagoa, ordered Idumange’s detention for 30 days pending Police investigation.
Idumange, who alleged that officials of Bayelsa government diverted a N3 billion Agric loan, was arrested on March 10 and charged to court the next day.
Some officials of the Bayelsa government had reported to the Police that Idumange had made seditious publications that maligned their persons in his claims.
However, the State High Court, Sagbama Division, granted bail to Idumange, who was also an aide on Research and Documentation and later Social Media to former Gov. Seriake Dickson.
The case was earlier assigned to Justice Ebiyerin Omukoro, but later reassigned to Justice Uzakah.
