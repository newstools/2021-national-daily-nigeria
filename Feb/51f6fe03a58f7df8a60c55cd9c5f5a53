Rev. Yakubu Pam, the Executive Secretary of Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC), has said the claims that the board has appointed the renowned actress Tonto Dikeh, as its Peace Ambassador is untrue.



 


Recall that the 35-year-old movie star who has been in the news for different reasons recently ignited fresh controversy on Friday when she announced that the commission had named her as its peace ambassador.
Her claim had sparked widespread criticism on social media with many Nigerian users lambasting the commission for the said appointment.
Amid the dust, Pam openly dismissed the movie star’s claim stating that the NCPC wishes to state in categorical terms that the Commission did not appointed King Tonto Dikeh a peace Ambassador.


According to a statement sent to our correspondent on Saturday Pam said: “Tonto Dikeh, a founder of Tonto Dikeh Foundation only visited the Commission and  expresse her willingness and interest in partnering with the Commission in the area of peace building. She equally cashed in on the visit to commend the NCPC boss for his positive and relentless peace initiatives across the country.

“But we are suddenly inundated with claims from King Tonto Dikeh herself that she has been officially appointed as Ambassador of peace by this great Commission. This claim has gone virile in the media. The Commission frowns at this claim which is a clear misrepresentation of  what transpired.

“The fact remains that the Executive Secretary of NCPC never appointed King  Tonto Dikeh an Ambassador of Peace for NCPC and this was not part of her visit  therefore this claim by her is spurious, unfounded and should be discarded and seen by all Nigerians as a figment of her imagination”, Pam said.
