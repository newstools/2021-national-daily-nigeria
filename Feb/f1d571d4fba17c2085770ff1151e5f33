Nigerian music executive, Michael Collins Ajereh aka Don Jazzy, has revealed why he is yet to walk down the aisle.
In a recent interview with media personality Nancy Isime, Don Jazzy said he is not prepared to maintain a relationship with just one woman.
The music honcho claimed that he does not have the capability to be “monogamous.”
Don Jazzy said: “I don’t believe I’m strong enough to be with just one person. Yes, I think people will run away from me for being truthful. I cannot be dating you and tell you that you are the only one I am dating.
“Some people have the strength of when you are attracted to somebody the thing that used to make you attracted to other people turns off. I hail you people.
“You are a beautiful woman, but that doesn’t stop me from admiring madam over there. She’s still beautiful.”
Don Jazzy is a Nigerian record producer, audio engineer, record executive, singer, songwriter, entrepreneur, and philanthropist.
He is the founder and the Chief Executive of Mavin Records
