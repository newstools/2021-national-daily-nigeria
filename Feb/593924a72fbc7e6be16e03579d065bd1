Former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State, on Thursday expressed deep shock over the demise of the first civilian Governor of the State, Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande.
Jakande passed on in the early hours of Thursday at the age of 91 years.
Ambode in a statement by his Executive Assistant, Hunsu Peter, on Thursday, declared: “the news of the demise of Baba Jakande came to me as a rude shock. He was ripe at age, but we had hoped he would live to celebrate a centenary.” The former governor emphasized that Jakande’s life symbolized humility, uprightness and honesty. “He was an exemplary leader, a perfect gentleman and a man of integrity and character. Lagos will forever be grateful to him for his unparalled service,” Ambode said.
He narrated: “When I was in office I always looked forward to his fatherly advice and encouragement. Apart from that was his visible presence at state events, even with his health condition never deterred him from giving his support. This shows how he lived a very humbled and upright life throughout his sojourn here on earth”.
Ambode extended his condolence to the entire family of Jakande and, especially, his wife, Alhaja Abimbola, whom he said had stood solidly by Baba throughout the period of his later years.
 
“This is a big loss to Lagosians and Nigerians, in general. But we take solace in the fact that he left huge footprints that will remain indelible in the minds of progressive Lagosians,” Ambode said.
