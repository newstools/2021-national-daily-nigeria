Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, on Thursday expressed doubt if President Muhammadu Buhari is still controlling the country’s affairs.
Soyinka, who featured in a programme on Arise TV on Thursday, insisted that if the President is indeed in charge of Nigeria, the country’s security situation would not have deteriorated to its present level.
“I have said it again and again. I don’t believe Buhari is in charge because it is not possible in my view for a head of state, a commander-in-chief of the armed forces to say he is presiding over a nation and things get to this level.
“Something is critically wrong within the leadership of this nation and that is where we civilians must come in, we must pick up the slack for our own situation, for our own salvation.
“What happened to me in this incident is typical of what happened to millions in this country and we cannot just sit still and say we are relying on central help when obviously, it is not coming.”
He also challenged President Buhari to address Nigerians on the crisis and declare publicly that he does not support the criminal activities of some herdsmen in various parts of the country.
He said: “Buhari does not appreciate the situation, he doesn’t understand, I see no evidence that he understands how grave the situation is.
