The Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has recently called for Crypto regulation knowing fully well the role Crypto plays in the global financial ecosystem as he opined that such disruption often makes room for progress.
He stressed the importance Cryptocurrencies would play in the coming years as they will most likely challenge traditional banking, including reserve banking, in ways the world hasn’t yet imagined, stressing the need for Nigeria in being prepared for such a seismic shift.
He also called for scaling up of government-private sector interventions because, “the task of national development requires that we fire on all cylinders, after all at one stage China was building 1.9m housing units per year.”
Osinbajo also advised the SEC, and Central Bank of Nigeria in creating a regulatory road map, while fully appreciating the stance of the CBN, Nigerian SEC, and law enforcement agencies on the possible abuses of crypto assets.
