No fewer than 300 schoolgirls of Government Girls Secondary, Jangebe, Mafara LGA, Zamfara, have been kidnapped by gunmen believed to be bandits.
The bandits arrived the school around 1am on Friday with Hilux vehicles and motorcycles and forcefully evacuated the students.
According to sources, the bandits were in uniforms and pretended to be security agents.
The Punch reported that a parent of one of the girls, who gave his name as Malam Lawal Jangebe, said, “I nearly fainted when I heard about the abduction of the students including my daughter.”
The police has confirmed the incident.
Bandits have been on the rampage lately across the north, snatching batches of government college students.
Katsina, Niger, and Zamfara have witnessed at least one incident each between January and February.
Many complained of among other things, President Muhammadu Buhari unwillingness to sack his former service chiefs, as the reason for the escalating insecurity.
But there has been no significant improvement since the president replaced the military brass weeks ago.
