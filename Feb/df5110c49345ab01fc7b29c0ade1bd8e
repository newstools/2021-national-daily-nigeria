The Nigerian Senate on Thursday commenced the screening of the former service chiefs nominated by President Muhammadu Buhari for ambassadorial appointments. The former service chiefs were at the office of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs on Thursday morning waiting to be screened by the lawmakers. The retired service chiefs include Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Olonisakin; Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas; and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar.
The Senate Committee first held a closed-door session before the screening could begin as the former service chiefs were kept waiting in a separate office to be invited either individually or collectively for screening.
