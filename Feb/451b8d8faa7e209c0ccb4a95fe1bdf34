Some Fulani-Bororo herders Ibarapaland are fighting back as their host communities agitate for their push out of the towns, especially Igangan, in that part of Oyo.
The latest pushback happened at Okolo, towards Eruwa, on Sunday, around 1 pm. And it was violent.
The villagers are being attacked by all sorts of guns, according to a resident who sent an SOS message to Taiwo Adeogun, secretary to the Farmer Association of Ibarapaland.
Adeogun is at the forefront of tackling Fulani herdsmen violence in the area.
The scare the Sunday attack generated has spread as far as Eruwa.
“Te people of Eruwa are now scampering here and there,” the message read.
Travelling en-route from Ibadan to Eruwa has now become dangerous as vehicles were shot at on Saturday.
As at Friday, only one police checkpoint appeared along the road, and it was at Okolo.
