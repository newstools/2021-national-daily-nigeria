The Abia State Police Command successfully neutralised four attackers, arrested eight persons and recovered arms and ammunition from hoodlums who carried out an unprovoked attack on the Abayi Police Station, Aba, Osisioma Ngwa LGA, Abia State, in the early hours of Tuesday.
The Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, CP Frank Mba, in a statement on Wednesday disclosed that the hoodlums numbering about 200 persons, armed with AK47 rifles and matchets invaded the station and set part of it ablaze with the aid of petrol bombs and other explosives. CP Mba decried that following the attack, two officers, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, ASP Vincent Gonze, and Sergeant Emmanuel Okoronkwo, unfortunately, paid the supreme price.
CP Mba indicated that the Inspector General of Police, IGP M.A. Adamu, commiserated with the family and friends of the deceased officers. He warned that dire consequences await any person or group of persons who, under whatever guise, engages in an unwarranted attack on any public property and directs all Command CPs to employ all legally permissible measures to protect lives and property
Meanwhile, investigation is still ongoing, and the perpetrators of the unwholesome incident will be prosecuted in due course, Mba said. The police high command called on proprietors of medical facilities – both public and private – in and around Abia State to report any person(s) found seeking medical treatment for bullet wounds and other related injuries to the nearest police station.
