PDP’s national chairman, Uche Secondus, might be pretty set to leave the party’s national leadership—or he will be frozen out.
The Tuesday meeting of the party’s National Working Committee was largely conducted to deliberate on the failure and incompetence of Secondus.
According to reports, the allegations levelled against him include financial mismanagement, poor crisis management, and the chances he might be the party’s dead hand of the clock in the 2023 presidential election preparation.
The PDP has been in crisis for a while now, across the nation, from Cross Rivers, Oyo, Ekiti, to Lagos and other states.
The champion of his removal believe all these have weakened the PDP as opposition needed in a situation where the ruling APC is also rudderless.
His unilateral reinstatement of PDP reps suspended in June 2019 when they supported APC Majority Leader Femi Gbajabiamila to become Speaker.
Secondus had single-handedly restored Ndudi Elmelu and others—against the NWC wish.
To cap it all, Secondus, who powered into the national leadership level with the backwind from Rivers Gov Nyesom Wike, has fallen out with his benefactor.
Wike, many believe, has been the bullyboy of the PDP, anybody who defies him usually goes down.
