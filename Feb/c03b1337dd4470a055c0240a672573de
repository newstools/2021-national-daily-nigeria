President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday received reports of the brazen attack on Government Science College, Kagara, Rafi Local Government Area, Niger State, in which a yet to be ascertained number of staff and students have been abducted by gunmen.
Following these reports, the President has directed the Armed Forces and Police, to ensure immediate and safe return of all the captives. The President also dispatched to Minna, Niger State, a team of security chiefs to coordinate the rescue operation and meet with state officials, community leaders, as well as parents and staff of the College.
President Buhari assured of the support of his administration to the Armed Forces in their brave struggle against terrorism and banditry, urging them to do all that can be done to bring an end to this saga, and avoid such cowardly attacks on schools in the future.
“Our prayers are with families of the victims of this attack,” the President said as he condemned as cowardly the attack on innocent school children.
