A prominent leader in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Salihu Lukman, Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum, on Sunday decried the noticeable failure of the Buhari administration and the APC government to protect lives and property as well as guarantee the corporate existence of Nigeria. He, accordingly, advocated for an emergency meeting of the party to deliberate on issues of injustice and emerging violent resistance in the country.
Salihu Lukman, in a statement on Sunday – “Cries for Justice: Shasha and the Burden of Political Leadership”, indicated that the party in government owes Nigerians the duty of addressing the prejudicial narrative that is stimulating ethnicity and drums of wars.
The Progressives Governors Forum Director General further advocated that APC should sanction political leaders promoting or instigating politics of ethnic hatred. He maintained that the level of intolerance in Nigeria of ethnic background is beyond imagination.
He condemned the skirmishes between Yoruba and Hausa traders in Shasha, Oyo State; he advocated for justice in Nigeria irrespective of who is affected. Lukman cautioned that compromise of justice erodes the foundation of democracy.
