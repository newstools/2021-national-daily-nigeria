A former presidential aspirant in the 2019 general elections, Oby Ezekwesili has raised serious doubts about the mental and physical health of President Muhammadu Buhari following the inability of his administration to curb the rising insecurity in the country.
Ezekwesili, a former Minister of Education, who disclosed this amidst a growing level of insecurity in the country and an increasing rate of kidnapping in the North, especially in schools, called for the mental and physical evaluation of President Buhari’s health.
According to Ezekwesili, her demands went beyond asking Buhari and his government to bring back the missing Chibok girls, rescue the recently abducted students of Government Girls’ Secondary School, GGSS, in Zamfara, and others.
She said there was the need to commence the process of checking the President’s mental and physical health.
“My demand goes beyond asking @NigeriaGov of @MBuhari to #BringBackJangebeGirls,” she tweeted.
“My demand goes beyond asking Justice of Rescue for our schoolgirls.
“My demand is to commence the process for an independent medical evaluation of @MBuhari’s physical and mental capacity to govern,” she tweeted.
