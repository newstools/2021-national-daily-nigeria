Oyo Gov. Seyi Makinde is ready to jump ship as leadership crisis rocks the ruling PDP in its only state in the southwest.
According to an insider, though the arrangement hasn’t solidified yet, there is possibility Makinde will end up in the African Democratic Congress soon.
The defection is tentatively set: after the forthcoming local government elections in the state.
But Mr. Taiwo Adisa, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Makinde, in a swift reaction, described the story as “a concocted falsehood from purveyors of fake news, who are bent on maligning the governor at all cost”.
Adisa said contrary to the report, Makinde had no plan to join another party.
Parts of the hint at the defection is the exit of the governor from the WhatsApp group of PDP’ stalwart in Oyo.
Makinde left the group because the party’s state publicity secretary, Akeem Olatunji, charged him to tackle insecurity in the state.
The baby governor has also been at loggerheads with Ekiti’s ex-Gov Ayo Fayose over who leads the party in the region.
