The kidnapped schoolgirls of Government Secondary School in Jangebe, Zamfara, have been released.
They are currently in the palace of the Emir of Anka waiting for transportation to Gusau, the state capital.
No fewer than 300 of them were abducted very early on Friday.
Not much information was heard about the kidnappers and their demand. But the federal government deployed troops in pursuit of the criminals as quickly as possible.
The girls’ abduction followed a similar incident involving college students—boys—in Niger same week.
Both batches of hostages have been released.
