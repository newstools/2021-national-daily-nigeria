The strike force unit of the Nigeria Police, SWAT,  arrested some kidnappers at the point of ransom collection from victim in Bayelsa State. The SWAT team of the Bayelsa State Police Command, in collaboration with the Bayelsa Vigilante Group successfully foiled the kidnap and ransom payment on a female victim who was compelled by the kidnappers at gunpoint to make withdrawals, using her ATM cards, from different banks’ ATM machines in Yenagoa.
It was disclosed that the victim, Judith Adoga, a civil servant, was obstructed on the road while she was driving by four kidnappers who disguised the state’s Environmental Sanitation Authority officials.
The victim had narrated that she was captured and driven off in her vehicle. According to Judith Adoga, “she was not only forced to withdraw all the money in her bank account but also told to demand money from family members and friends before she would be released.”
Fortunately, one of the relations who was called for money had made a distress call to the police and the Bayelsa Vigilante group, who were said to swing into action immediately and succeeded in tracking the kidnappers at Okutukutu Community, in the Yenagoa environs.
The Public Relations Officer of the Bayelsa State Police Command, Asinim Buswat, acknowledged the foiled kidnap and ransom collection, disclosing that two suspects, Ebi Tonbofa and Headman Eniye, had been arrested by the team, adding that a revolver pistol with three rounds of bullets was also recovered from them. The PPRO noted that the arrested suspects are assisting the police in their investigations, adding that they would soon be charged to court.
