Some guests in a popular Hotel in Ogun state have raised an alarm following the discovery of hidden cameras secretly installed in their hotel rooms.
It was learnt that the cameras were hidden in the AC, such that it was difficult to notice it.
The occupants of the rooms who discovered five cameras in the rooms they lodged in questioned why cameras should be in rooms, thereby denying guests their privacy.
One of the men is seen lamenting that the camera has obviously captured his mother’s nakedness because she leaves the bathroom for her room naked.
“This is a room in the hotel we are sleeping in Ayepe, we just found out that there’s a camera installed in every room. These are the four we removed from other rooms. This has recorded my mother’s nakedness, this is the fifth camera in the room,” he said.
Meanwhile, actor Femi Branch and other stars have demanded a full investigation into the matter.
The actor pointed out that people expect privacy in hotels and as a result, they count money in their hotel rooms and make calls revealing some sensitive information, not knowing they are being filmed.
He called on the Nigerian police to investigate the hotel, adding that if anyone has been robbed after leaving the premises, the hotel should be held responsible.
Comedian Lepacious Bose and actress Bukky Wright also called for the hotel to be investigated.
