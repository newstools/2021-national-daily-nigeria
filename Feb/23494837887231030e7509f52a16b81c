The National Vice Chairman, South-South, of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dan Orbih, on Friday eulogized the leadership virtues and legacies of the first civilian Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, who died on Thursday at 91` years.
Orbih lamented that Nigeria has lost another patriotic, incorruptible, and selfless leader. He celebrated late Jakande as a leader who ignored unbridled acquisition of wealth for the service of humanity.
Orbih recalled that the demised Jakande, known Baba Kekere, from a symbol of his water transportation policy, was a political pupil of Chief Obafemi Awolowo of evergreen memory, leader of the defunct Action Group (AG), and the later Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN).
Orbih remarked that the late Jakande implemented all the four cardinal programmes of the defunct UPN to stimulate human capital development, capacity building and industrialization.
“Jakande made his mark in the provision of affordable houses, free education, free health services and integrated rural and urban development in Lagos State.
 
“In fact, he left his mark in the development of Lagos State. Above all, he left office poorer than he was before he was elected.
“His outstanding performance as Governor of Lagos State was second to none. He lived a life of contentment. I pray God to grant him eternal rest,” Orbih declared.
