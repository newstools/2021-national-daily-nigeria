President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to appoint an Acting Inspector General of Police as the incumbent IGP, Mohammed Adamu, retires on Monday. The federal government cannot afford the luxury of not appointing an Acting IGP for proper organization of the Nigerian Police Force in the face of the rising crime wave in Nigeria.
However, the Presidency on Monday disclosed that there was no date yet for the appointment of a new Inspector-General of Police on the exit of Adamu.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Sunrise Daily on Channels Television on Monday monitored from Lagos, was of the view that the President has not decided any date for the appointment of a new IGP, saying he is not aware of the imminent announcement of a new police chief.
According to Garba Shehu, “The President returns to Abuja on Tuesday. He should be on his desk by Wednesday. I do not know when he will do this. One thing I can assure you is that in places sensitive like that, there is no vacuum that will subsist; therefore, the system will take care of itself.”
President Buhari appears to be at crossroads of performing his official duties, being away from office on day of crucial issue of government, essentially, the retirement of the IG of Police and the need to appoint a successor.
Garba Shehu may have gone on a goose chase in raising the issue of uncertainty on the date the President will announce the appointment of a new IG of Police. The President’s official duties is not restricted to the confine of his office, particularly, issues of decision making. And if anything, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, could be delegated to perform such duties in his absence.
However, Garba Shehu may be revealing the intention of President Buhari to appoint an Acting Inspector General of Police in the interim.
