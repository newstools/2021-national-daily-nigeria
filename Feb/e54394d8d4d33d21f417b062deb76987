The Lagos State Police Command has issued a 14-day grace to Nigerians who have their accidental and exhibit vehicles or items parked at various police formations across the state to claim them or forfeit them to the State.
In a statement signed by the Lagos State Police Command Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the Command said it would be left with the option of selling off the cars and items on public auction after due court processes if owners failed to complete them after the 14 days grace.
Adejobi said the State Police Command detests the manner in which police formations in the state are littered with such exhibit cars and items and therefore directs the Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and Heads of Departments to decongest their formations of the items without delay.
