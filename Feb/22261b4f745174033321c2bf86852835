Former Governor Gbenga Daniel has joined the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) after months of dalliance with the Ogun ruling party.
He fell out with his former party PDP when he was removed as campaign manager of the party’s presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar in 2019.
Apologising to his colleague for the suddenness of the defection, Daniel said his love for Gov Dapo Abiodun shoud have told anyone who cares to know..
According to him, it became urgent after request of the national caretaker Chairman of APC to visit him along with three governors.
“While planning for the visit Governor Abiodun also decided to visit me later today with another set of Governors later today,” he said.
“It therefore means that I have finally been ‘captured’ “I thought I should quickly brief the house before the news go viral. Thanks for your understanding OTUNBA GBENGA DANIELS.’
Party stalwarts in the PDP have been skipping into the ruling APC after its caretaker committee toured the country for reconciliation and membership campaign.
