President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday expressed “great shock and deep concern” over the eruption of violence in Gombe State following the Billiri chieftaincy tussle.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in statement on Sunday, indicated that President Buhari said: “I’m seriously disturbed by the outbreak of violence in Gombe State and call on the parties involved to exercise maximum restraint to avoid escalation.”
The President maintained: “the easy resort to violence is uncalled for because there are enough avenues to resolve differences amicably without threatening law and order.”
The president further decaled: “in a circle of violence, there are no winners, except losers,” advising Muslims and Christians to “avoid the temptation of resorting to violence in order to express their grievances.”
“Nigerians have shed enough blood over issues that could have been peacefully resolved. I appeal to the two parties to sheathe their swords for the sake of peaceful coexistence. Gombe has enjoyed relative religious harmony for decades and you shouldn’t allow hoodlums destroy this positive record.”
