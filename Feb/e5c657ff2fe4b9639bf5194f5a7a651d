As activists prepare to scuttle Abdurasheed Bawa’s appointment as EFCC chairman, the presidency that nominated the 40-year-old level 13 officer is not relenting either.
Court papers were on Friday served the Senate President Ahmed Lawan who will preside over the Senate screen and confirmation of Bawa.
Among other complaints, the suit filed by Okechukwu Osuagwu insisted Bawa is a level 13 officer nominated for a level 15 office.
But Aso Rock has its plan.
In the effort to install Bawa, the presidency promoted him on Friday, back-dated the promotion with immediate effect.
His course mates however said the promotion was long overdue but for red tapism.
“Bawa and his mates who are part of the pioneer Course 1 of the EFCC Cadet Officers were supposed to have been promoted over a year ago but their promotions were being delayed by the police-led leadership of the commission,” the Punch quoted a source as saying.
