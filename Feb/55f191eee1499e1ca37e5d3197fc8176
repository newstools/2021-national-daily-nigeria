Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State has counseled the federal government to permit Nigerians to acquire licenced guns to defend themselves amid the increasing of security criss in the country.
Ishaku, hosting 15 local government chairmen on a condolence visit on Tuesday after the burial of Ardo-Kola, LGA chairman, Salihu Dovo, who was kidnapped and killed by bandits in the state emphasized that since the government cannot provide security for citizens, people should be allowed to carry guns and defend themselves.
The governor decried that the security crises have gone to the lowest ebb and require reawakening.
Governor Ishaku declared: “The security in this country has gone to the lowest ebb and we have to all wake up. We as leaders have given our advises severally as to the change to the security architecture, you cannot keep doing one thing over and over and expect a different result.
“If we cannot be able to provide security for our citizens, then, allow all the citizens to buy AK-47, because if everybody is licensed with AK-47, I swear nobody will come to your house, or peradventure he does then it depends on who is faster.
“In a situation where we are all gagged with one security system that has been unable to work, and we are told to sit down and be counting the day our turn will come, I do not agree with it.”
