Operatives of the Nigeria Police Force had on Friday swung into a coordinated air and land search and rescue operations in Zamfara State. The Force, accordingly, deployed both ground and aerial assets, aimed at locating and rescuing the students of the Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, Zamfara State, kidnapped in the early hours of Friday. The Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, CP Frank Mba, in a statement indicated that “to ensure the success of the ongoing operation, the Inspector-General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, has ordered the immediate deployment of two operational surveillance helicopters to Zamfara State. This is in addition to the personnel of Operation Puff Adder II earlier deployed to the State to support efforts by the Command to combat banditry, kidnapping and other related crimes.”
The IGP, while condemning the barbaric and callous abduction of the innocent female students, assured that the Police and other security forces will not relent until the abducted students are successfully rescued and reunited with their families. The joint rescue operation is being carried out by the Police, the Military and other members of the law enforcement community with support from the State Government and other Stakeholders, Mba disclosed.
The IGP appealed for calm, enjoining members of the public, particularly, the people of Zamfara State, not to hesitate in availing the Police and the law enforcement community with useful information that can assist in the rescue of the abducted school girls.
