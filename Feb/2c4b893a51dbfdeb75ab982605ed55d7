The grieving mum shared the sad news of his demise on Instagram

”Fun-50
For those who held you in their hearts,
Those you waved at on your strolls,
For those who cried the tears they couldn’t hold back,
Cos you are no more here,

For those who washed you when you were weak,
Those who were scared to see you ill,
For those who thought you madly stubborn cos you,
Wouldn’t take another pill

I salute them all, who shared you with me,
Paying for your bills,
Calling on others to give their dimes,
I appreciate the toils and tears and
All the memories you left for
Them

Leaving only me”

Jeremiah who was the first of Yinka’s two children would have been 28 on February 21.

May his soul rest in peace, Amen.
