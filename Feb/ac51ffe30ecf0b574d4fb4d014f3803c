The Commissioner of Police in Imo State, Nasiru Muhammed, has ordered detailed investigation into the suicide incident involving an Inspector of Police in the state.
An Inspector of Police said to be identified as Umoh, was said to have on Wednesday committed suicide by shooting himself to death on return from an official duty in Owerri, Imo State.
The PPRO of the Imo State Police Command, Orlando Ikeokwu, confirming the incident, said the CP has already ordered an investigation into the death.
It was highlighted that Inspector Umoh was serving at the Area Command Headquarters, Owerri, before his death.
The Inspector was said to have gone into a private room where he shot himself in the stomach and died before help could come.
A witness was cited to have narrated: “Mobile officers came back and one of them went into one of the rooms and locked himself in. The next minute, we heard a gunshot.
“When we approached the quarters, it was discovered the door was locked.
“We forced it open and the mobile policeman was found dead in a pool of his own blood.”
No one knows what would have prompted the police officer to take his own life. The investigation ordered by the CP is being awaited.
