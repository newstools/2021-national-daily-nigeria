Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on an assessment tour of the Benin Stormwater project at the Textile mill road, Benin City, berated former Governor Adams Oshiomhole, for a wasteful project which he said was going to fail from the beginning.
Former Governor Oshiomhole had set up the Benin stormwater project to provide permanent solution to flooding in the state.
However, flooding continued in the state after the establishment of the stormwater project, which subsequently generated controversies in the state.
Governor Obaseki inspecting the reconstruction work at Ekehuan road, was satisfied with the level of work done. It was indicated that the reconstruction work was initially scheduled for completion in 36 months but was reviewed for completion in 24 months.
