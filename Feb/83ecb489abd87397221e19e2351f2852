There has been a change of security aide to President Muhammadu Buhari. A new Aide-de-Camp (ADC) to President Buhari, Lieutenant. Colonel Yusuf Muktar Dodo, appointed earlier, early this week, resumed duties while the former ADC, Colonel Mohammed Lawal Abubakar, quit office.
The Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, in a statement, disclosed that Dodo, who was Academy Adjutant of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), was appointed ADC to the president in January.
He said that Abubakar handed over on Monday after Dodo had understudied him for about three weeks to learn the process of his new assignment; he added that the former and current ADCs concluded handing/taking over process, noting that the new ADC was accompanied by his wife and daughter during brief ceremony.
Garba Shehu highlighted that Colonel Mohammed Lawal Abubakar is due for the rank of Brigadier after completing promotional course in Chile. According to Shehu, he has been nominated to attend 5 months Strategic and Defence Course at Santiago Chile, from 8 March – 30 July 2021,
“The course is a prerequisite for his next promotion to the rank of Brigadier-General in the last quarter 2021 and posting outside the shores of the country as a Defence Attachee/Adviser is keeping in line with the customs and tradition of recognising Officers that served as Aide-De-Camp to the President and concluded tour of duty without any blemish,” Shehu explained.
It was pointed out that Abubakar, is the longest serving ADC to a civilian president (having served in that position for almost six years), and the second longest serving ADC in the history of Armed Forces of Nigeria after late Colonel Walbe who served General Yakubu Gowon for 9 years.
The 48-year-old ADC, who had served in various Army units and formations within and outside Nigeria at different capacities also recommended his successor by nominating three seasoned and trustworthy Army Officers to President Buhari, and the Commander-in-Chief picked Dodo, Shehu said.
