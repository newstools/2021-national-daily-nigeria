The DG further acknowledged seeing the woman and her child the bandits left out of their operation.
It was also indicated that government official was among the kidnap victims.
The DG was cited to have said in part: “…we have rescued the woman and her baby, and she is in the vehicle with us and we are on our way to Minna. She told us that the bandits blocked the way and went away with the other 18 passengers on the bus.
