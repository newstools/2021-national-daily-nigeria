In the heat of higher firepower and heavier bombardment by air and ground forces, Boko Haram’s fighters resorted to suicide attacks in one of the first drastic counterinsurgency battles in Borno, northeast, since change of service chiefs.
The federal troops from Sector 1 and 21 Brigade along with      the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) took the battle to the bases of the insurgents at Kidari, Argude, Takwala, Chowalta and Galdekore.
The terrorists, according to a military source PRNigeria quoted, initially resisted the onslaught. More personnel and heavy equipment redeployed in the area mounted more pressure.
So the terrorist started detonating their IEDs in a suicidal fashion.
The area — along the Maiduguri-Gwoza road—has been sealed off to avoid collateral damage.
A number of soldiers died in the suicide attacks, but the insurgents suffered heavier losses.
