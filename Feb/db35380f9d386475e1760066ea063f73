Warring factions of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State engaged in exchange of blows on Wednesday at the venue of the party’s membership revalidation and registration. Loyalists of Kwara the State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, questioned the authority of the State Caretaker Committee Chairman, Bashir Bolarinwa, to supervise the revalidation exercise in the state. He was subsequently beaten by the factional party members.
Thereafter, supporters of the Kwara State governor and supporters of the Caretaker Chairman were engaged in free for all fight, throwing chairs and other harmful objects in their opposite directions which momentarily disrupted the stakeholders meeting.
It was gathered that Senator John Danboi, leader of the Kwara State  membership revalidation committee had arrived Kwara State from Abuja for the exercise which was disrupted by the scuffle over asserting the authentic State Caretaker Chairman between Bashir Bolarinwa and Abdulahi Samari.
Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq was said to have led his faction to conduct the membership revalidation and registration exercise at another venue. The Kwara State governor made his membership revalidation at the alternative venue.
Invariably, the APC crisis in Kwara State is obviously deepening with a show of power between the governor and the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.
