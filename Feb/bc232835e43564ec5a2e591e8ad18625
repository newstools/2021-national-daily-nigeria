Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, chairman, Southwest Governors’ Forum, on Saturday appealed to the people of Ibadan, Oyo State, to resist the temptation of resorting to lawlessness after the violence outburst in Shasha area of the State.
The Ondo governor in a statement on Saturday night indicated the southwest governors “note with deep concern, the most unfortunate and avoidable orgy of violence in Shasha, Ibadan, the Oyo State Capital.”
Akeredolu explained that he was under pressure to speak to all residents of Ibadan and its environs, essentially, the Yoruba speaking people, on the recent security crisis in the area as Chairman, South-West Governors’ Forum.
Akeredolu declared: “Without doubt, the situation we have found ourselves as a people is most despicable and contends violently against, and abhorrently at variance with the values and hospitality for which our people are known.
“We have been known for thoroughness. We have identified with legality over the centuries; and our ethos as a civilised breed of people is such that we do not identify with lawlessness, not even illegality.”
The Ondo Governor admitted that he understands “the height of provocation in the light of recent happenings as regards Shasha, Ibadan.” He maintained: “I, alongside my other brother governors in the region are against the willful appropriation of Laws into one’s hands.
“We do not support violence and, brigandage, jungle justice and unnecessary self-help. We note with delight, the efforts of our brother Governor, Engr Seyi Makinde, of Oyo State, who has taken very bold steps to stave off the further escalation of the violence by imposing curfew in the affected areas.
“He deserves every support in his avowed commitment towards peace and security in Oyo State. We shall all survive these times and live peacefully, once again in our lands.”
