After his nomination for confirmation by the Senate, Abdulrasheed Bawa is having a wall of opposition to scale.
Apart from critics and groups kicking against the nomination, a lawyer, Osuagwu Ugochukwu has prayed a federal high court in Abuja to stop the Senate from confirming the nominee.
The office of the Senate President on Thursday got the court document marked FHC/ABJ/CS/196/2021.
Ugochukwu has claimed the EFCC Act states only a level 15 officer at the assistant commissioner of police level could appointed chairman, and Bawa is still at level 13.
The plaintiff also said Bawa has enjoyed speed promotion in his career though he’s not a regular police officer.
That allegation connects with others highlighting favoritism in the appointment.
The nominee is said to be related toAGF Abubakar Mlami, the minster in charge of the EFCC,.
Malami fought the suspended EFCC chairman to  a standstill.  The report of the presidential panel that probed Malami’s allegation of corruption against Magu has been swept under the carpet.
The AGF himself has a lot of corruption allegation against him.
Many believe he might be looking for a stooge to cover his track.
Bawa too was reported to have sold off hundreds of oil tankers to his cronies while he headed the EFCC Port Harcourt regional office.
The commission has debunked the allegation.
President Muhammadu Buhari has always had problem pushing his EFCC nominee through the Senate confirmation.
Magu, until his suspension six years after appointment, , was not confirmed by the Senate
