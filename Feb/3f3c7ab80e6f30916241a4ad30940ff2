Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka has lambasted the Ogun command of the Nigerian police, describing its narrative of herd invasion of his home as a mad lie.
In a statement, Soyinka explained how the cows descended on his forest home, and how the police dawdled before they response to invitation.
“I thoroughly resent the police version which suggests that the cows never invaded my home: home is not just a building; it includes its grounds. And it was not a stray cow, or two or three. It was a herd – we have photos, so why the lie? It is so unnecessary, unprofessional and suspiciously compromised,” Soyinka wrote.
The police in Ogun had claimed in a statement Tuesday that only one cow stayed into Soyinka’s compound.
“The entire place was inspected by the DPO and it was established that it was just a case of stray cow as nothing was damaged or tampered with,” the police said.
Soyinka warned that lie-telling is unprofessional.
“Failure to adhere to that obvious, basic form of conduct means that the public will lose total confidence in security agencies and constantly bypass them in times of civic unrest, no matter how trivial or deadly,” he said.
