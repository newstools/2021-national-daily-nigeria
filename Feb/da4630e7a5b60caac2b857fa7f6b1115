The Islamic human rights group, the Muslim Rights Concern, has spoken in a manner divorced from its usual way—protective—way of contributing to action and inaction of the President Muhammadu Buhari government.
On the raging violence of criminal Fulani herders, MURIC seems to be accusing the APC government of not doing enough.
In a statement on Friday, signed by its director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, the group insisted the Buhari administration is handling the farmer-herder crisis with levity.
MURIC said it is in possession of concrete evidence of the culpability of herdsmen, including video clips in which cows destroyed farms belonging to members of the organization.
“We sent out feelers to all states where we have branches of MURIC and the reports are overwhelmingly convincing,” he said.
“We asked our members to supply information on the activities of herdsmen in their states, including Abuja. In fact we were stupefied by the outcome.
“This is frightening. Farmers in Kwara State are afraid of going to their farms due to the activities of herders,” the group said.
The organization charges the President Muhammadu Buhari administration and State governments to take responsibility.
“It is very clear that the current government is yet to appreciate what farmers are going through in the hands of marauding herdsmen.
“What MURIC will like to suggest is that FG should roll out a compensation programme, albeit instalmentally, to be paid to farmers of all categories,” the professor said.
