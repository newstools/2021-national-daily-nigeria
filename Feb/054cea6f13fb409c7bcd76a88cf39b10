A lawmaker in the Nigerian National Assembly has said that former President Goodluck Jonathan is not qualified to contest for president again, stating that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) knows it but plots to use Dr. Jonathan to destabilise the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
 
The PDP member of the House of Representatives from Rivers State, O. K. Chinda, stated: “former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is not qualified to run for Presidential election, and they know it, but they want to use him to disorganise the PDP by pretending to offer GEJ the APC ticket.”
The lawmaker noted: “they want to lure Jonathan out of the PDP with some Governors and ex-Ministers and populate APC, only to later tell him that he is not qualified, then, it will be too late for them to go back to PDP.”
Chinda stated that GEJ has better wisdom than them and cannot give in to their cheap pranks.
The House of Reps member noted that “in 2017, they signed the constitutional amendment that disqualified GEJ from running a second term,” declaring: “and in 2021, they are urging him to come join them and run. That is evil, the height of witchcraft and wickedness in high places.”
Chinda cited Section 137(3) of the Constitution inserted by 4th Alteration No.16 of 2017 signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Alteration, according to Chinda prescribes: “A person who was sworn-in as President to complete the term for which another person was elected as President shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term.”
The legislator, therefore, cautioned: “We are not fools. APC and her evil cohorts should visit GEJ as a leader and an epitome of African democracy and forget their selfish and deceitful agenda of urging him to run for Presidency in 2023.
“They should leave GEJ alone to continue his statesman role and enjoy his global respect which they cannot attain and cannot tarnish.”
