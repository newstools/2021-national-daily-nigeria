After his visit to a den of kidnappers in Zamfara, Islamic Scholar Ahmed Gumi has warned the government at all levels to watch out.
Addressing newsmen at the chamber of the Government House in Gusau, the state capital, sheikh Gumi explained that what he witnessed on Thursday wasn’t just kidnapping. It was an insurgency which higher firepower cannot stop. He referred to the criminals as Fulani unrepentant bandits.
“Negotiations remain the best option for conflict resolution. Negotiations settled the grievances of the militants in the South-South so president Buhari should borrow from that ideology to end terror attacks in his own government,” sheikh Gumi added.
According to Sheikh Gumi, almost all the crimes in Nigeria are being perpetrated by the unemployed youths who have no defined means of livelihood for a number of years, pointing out that a hungry man is an angry man.
The Fulani unrepentant bandits also complained of injustice dealing with the Fulani people, saying that both the security agencies and the outlawed Yansakai members have classified the Fulani people as third-class citizens in a country that belongs to everybody.
“In some of our communities, there is no potable drinking water, no accessible road, no good health care delivery service or any form of social facility and until the state government addresses these problems, we will not embrace the peace accord and reconciliation” the unrepentant bandits lamented.
“There is nowhere that peace can reign without justice and if there is justice, the federal and state governments would not have been wasting huge amount of money to quell banditry in the state”
Gumi cited how the Yar’ Adua presidency succeeded in abating the Niger Delta crisis by applying amnesty.
He then urged President Muhammadu Buhari to pardon the bandits and keep its promises of poverty alleviation for them.
