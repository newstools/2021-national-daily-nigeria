In less than 48 hours, the Nigerian troops and the MNJTF fighting insurgents in the northwest have made a couple of resounding statements in the Operation Tura Ta Kai Bango,  the second one on Thursday when they  routed the jihadists trying to overrun Gamboru Ngala, Borno.
Military sources told PRNigeria that the terrorists advanced towards the town from various locations.
But the federal forces which have been in control of the area countered the criminals, killing a number of them.
Items recovered included a gun truck, motorcycles and weapons.
A mop-up is going on now-in search of the wounded and others in hiding.
The general area is being combed in search of terrorists in hiding.
A similar encounter on Wednesday piled up the pressure on the terrorists, who resorted to suicide bombing in the midst of shellacking by the federal troops.
