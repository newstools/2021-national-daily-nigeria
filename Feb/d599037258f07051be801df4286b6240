The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, says the subtle political move by some Northern APC governors to lure former Goodluck Jonathan to vie for 2023 presidential election is targeted at sidelining and frustrating the golden chances of Igbo man or Southeast zone to emerge as president of Nigeria.
The group said the move was “a dangerous systematic way of creating and re-establishing another political discord among the people of the old eastern region”.
A statement signed by MASSOB leader, Comrade Uchenna Madu, said former President Goodluck Jonathan and his Ijaw kinsmen should be wise enough to discern this subtle and hypocritical move of Arewa Governors.
He called on all the political parties to ensure that their presidential ticket is given to credible South Easterners as a way of ensuring equity, justice and fairness in the Nigeria project.
“The people of Southeast and the indigenous Igbo in the South-south region have always supported the Ijaws, particularly on the presidency of Goodluck Jonathan during his political travails in the hands of Arewa leaders.
MASSOB also warned Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi state to bury their presidential ambitions in 2023 because it is solely and sacrosanct for the Southeast zone to produce the next president of Nigeria.
“It is not about sentiment or selfishness to support the Southeast zone; it is the turn of the Southeast zone to produce the next president of Nigeria according to the zoning arrangement.
“Nigeria is already sitting on an explosive time bomb that will eventually explode in 2023 if justice and national integration are not done to the people of Southeast in producing the next president of Nigeria.
