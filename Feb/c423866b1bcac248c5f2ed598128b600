Former Interim National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bisi Akande, on Wednesday berated the leadership of the party for embarking on what he called wasteful and improper use of funds in the membership registration and revalidation exercise. Akande decried that the exercise is a sheer waste of resources in relation to the country’s current economic reality.
The former APC interim national chairman at the registration and revalidation centre at Ila-orangun, headquarters of Ila Local Government Area, Osun State, his hometown, argued that the party leadership decision to carry out membership registration and revalidation less than a decade after the original registration is indefensible and an aberration.
Akande declared that “APC leadership appears to be wasteful and unappreciative of the proper use of money in a kind of scanty economy in which Nigeria now finds itself.” He maintained that the party seems to lack comprehension and matrix of the modern day technology.
Akande further condemned the idea of protracted caretaker committee in APC. The former interim national chairman admonished the Caretaker Executive Committee to resist the temptations of sit-tight syndromes that usually characterized most handpicked authorities in some underdeveloped countries of the world.
The former governor encouraged all APC stakeholders to work for the best of the party.
