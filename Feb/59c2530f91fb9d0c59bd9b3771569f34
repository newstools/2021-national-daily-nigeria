Nigeria’s immediate past President, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has finally opened up on his rumoured planned defection from the Peoples Democratic Party to the ruling all Progressives Congress ahead of the 2023 general elections.
Speaking at a Thanksgiving service of the Bayelsa State governor, Douye Diri, the former president described PDP “as a friend that carries people along.”
He made it known that he has not defected to the party and is still a full member of the People Democratic Party.
According to Jonathan: “PDP has been a very friendly party, I am a member of PDP and I know from the beginning till today, it has been a very friendly party, PDP is a party that carries everybody along and we should extend that to Bayelsa State.
Jonathan has been linked with a possible move to the APC after he played host to some chieftains of the ruling party.
According to some reports, the All Progressives Congress is considering giving a joint ticket to the former President and Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, for the 2023 presidential election.
It was gathered that Jonathan is being considered as a strong voice in the southern region, while El-Rufai is being packaged to represent northern interests and later become the president when the presidency is again zoned to the North.
Meanwhile, the interim Caretaker Committee Chairman of the APC, Mai Mala Buni had denied such claims.
