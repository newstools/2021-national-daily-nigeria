The Senate at a plenary on Wednesday finally confirmed the appointment of Abdulrasheed Bawa as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Commission.
Bawa’s nomination was shrouded in controversies, ranging from his quick-fire promotion to his scandalous sale of impounnded tankers in Port Harcourt when he headed the south-south region.
He has however denied involvement in the auction of the vehicles.
Bawa is heading the commission after his former boss Ibrahim Magu was eased out of office for allegations he has vehemently denied—even before the Justice Ayo Salami panel set up to look into the matter last year.
Magu was neer confirmed as chairman for the six years he headed the office.
