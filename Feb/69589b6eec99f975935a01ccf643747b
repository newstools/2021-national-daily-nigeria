A member of the House of Representatives, representing Kaura-Namoda Federal Constituency of Zamfara, Sani Dan-Galadima, has forfeited a N60m property used as a bail bond for fugitive Faisal Maina, son of ex-Chairman, defunct Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina.
The Economic and financial Crimes Commission, EFCC’s lawyer, Mohammed Abubakar told Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja on Thursday at the resumed hearing in his money laundering trial that Faisal sneaked to the USA through the Republic of Niger.
Faisal, who is being tried before the same judge with his father, went underground, the same way Maina did after they were granted bail.
While Maina was re-arrested in Niger Republic and has since been ordered to be remanded in Kuje prison, Abuja, his son had remained elusive until EFCC got intelligence that he has since fled to the US where he is believed to be a citizen.
Abubakar told the court on Thursday from the information at the disposal of the anti-graft agency, Faisal sneaked to the USA through the Republic of Niger.
Justice Abang ordered among others, that Sani Dan-Galadima representing Kaura-Namoda Federal Constituency of Zamfara who stood surety for the fleeing Faisal, should forfeit his property, worth 60 Million, which he pledged as guarantee for the N60m bail bond he signed.
