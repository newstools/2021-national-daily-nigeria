The Boko Haram terrorists invaded the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State, on April 14, 2014, where they kidnapped 276 girls identified to be between the age of 12 and 17 years.
The female students were abducted from their hostels and forced into trucks which were driven by the terrorists into the forest.
Sources revealed that 57 of the kidnapped girls struggled to flee from the terrorists in risky circumstances.
The destination of the kidnapped girls could not be ascertained over the years but the Sambisa Forest has remained a remarkable warfare zone of the Boko Haram terrorists.
There were reports of some girls being rescued by troops in 2016; some others were said to have escaped over time.
