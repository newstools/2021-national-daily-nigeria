The British High Commissioner to Nigeria has joined the Twitter craze sparked Feb 16 in celebration of Nigeria’s development economist Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala who recently got elected World Trade Organisation’s director-general.
Nigerian womenestarted the Be Like Ngozi challenge on Twitter with contestants doing their damnedest to dress up like Ngozi.
In a video released via her verified Twitter handle, the British high commissioner Ctriona Laing was seen attired like the Nigerian,.
“Hey, my sister Ngozi, we are so proud of you, the new director-general of the World Trade Organisation. Congratulations!”  She said
“And all you young girls out there, see what you can achieve, you can be brilliant in your career but also be yourself,” Laing advised.
While she was commended for shattering the glass ceiling as the first woman and the first African to head the global body, she has also become a model of sort in her home country.
The  challenge is already burning Twitter.
Nigerian women are now dressing up the way Ngozi dresses: African fabric, basically skirt and blouse, with the head gear, same fabric to match. All the time.
Obviously, everybody likes the sweet smell of success.
