The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has cautioned that the state will not cede any portion of land for development of ranching for the Fulani herdsmen to graze cattle.
Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie Esq., in a statement, refuted reports that the governor plans to build a ranch in the state for grazing of cattle.
The SSG in the statement declared: “Our attention has been drawn to misleading and false media reports claiming that the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has agreed to provide grazing land for herders in the state.
“Our position on the matter of grazing land is clear and has not shifted, which is that there is no free land for grazing in Edo State. Grazing is an economic activity just like poultry and piggery or any other agricultural enterprise. The Edo State Government will not cede any land in the state for grazing.
“The governor has continually warned against the politicizing of security issues.”
The SSG decried that defeated politicians in the state are jealous of Governor Obaseki’s proactive measures with security agencies to protect Edo State. The state government warned those stoking fire and instigating pandemonium in the state.
 “Thankfully, their plans have failed because of the pre-emptive actions taken by Governor Obaseki and the security agencies.
“We condemn, in the strongest terms, the current futile efforts by these defeated politicians in the state to cause mayhem and chaos among our people.
“All peace-loving people of Edo State are enjoined to dedicate this Lenten period to pray for peace at this difficult time in the life of our dear country,” the SSG declared.
