There is rising tension in Ogun State after herdsmen invaded a rural community on Saturday night, killing three persons and burning houses in Orile Igbooro, in Yewa North Local Government Area of Ogun State, a border community between Nigeria and Benin Republic.
Indigenes were helpless as the invaders took them unaware while they were still asleep at night. The indigenes were said to have narrated that the herdsmen invaded that community while they were still sleeping. They lamented that nine persons were injured in the attack at the midnight on Saturday. Many indigenes have since the attack been living in palpable fear.
The Ogun State Police Command was gathered to have acknowledged the invasion of the community and the killing of three persons. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Ogun State, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, was gathered to have admitted that the attackers killed three children.
There were indications that Fulani herdsmen may identified a convenient settlement in the border communities on the Ogun State route to Benin Republic where it is facile for them to launch attack at will.
Several parts of Owode Ketu in Ogun State were attacked on Friday and two persons were identified to be killed in that operation. The invaders burnt houses, destroyed farm produce barns, burnt vehicles and generators.
The southwest is becoming a theater of latent war by external forces to conquer the territory.
