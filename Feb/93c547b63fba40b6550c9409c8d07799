Tottenham Hotspur have endured a dreadful form lately where they have suffered five losses from their recent seven matches.
 
Many have been forced to question Jose Mourinho’s ability to turn the fortunes of the Lilywhites who were occupying the top spot in the English Premier League (EPL) table at mid-December last year. But a run of just two wins from their following nine league games has left them in a staggering 17 points away from leaders Manchester City.
 
Amid the disappointing results, Mourinho’s style of football and the team’s defensive frailties have continued to be highlighted by critics.
 
Manchester City’s 3-0 hammering of Mourinho’s men on Saturday was Tottenham’s seventh loss in their 23 EPL games this season.
 
Mourinho however, is not alien to being sacked since his arrival at the EPL where he has experienced two sacks from Chelsea and one from Manchester United.
 
Meanwhile, the Portuguese may be able to avoid similar experiences from Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford as National Daily understands that Daniel Levy is in no hurry to axe Jose Mourinho.
 
Mourinho and his men have not only seen their shot at the EPL title crumbled, but they are currently fighting to ensure a top four finish which they have enjoyed five times in the last ten years.
Though the uncertainties of missing out in the top European competition have piled up the pressure on Mourinho, but not on his position as the boss at White Hart Lane going by Daniel Levy decision against inserting a break clause in the former Real Madrid boss contract when he engaged him in 2019 and is contracted till the summer of 2023.
Sequel to the above, Tottenham hierarchy is reported to be willing to back the Portuguese in a bid for survival as gathered by National Daily from a report by the Athletic that the north London club will not rush into a decision over Mourinho’s future despite their current struggles.
