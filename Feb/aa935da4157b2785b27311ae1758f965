A bandit leader in the forest of Zamfara has indicted government for breaching agreements, and asked President Muhammadu Buhari to come over and preside over a fresh peace deal.
Halilu Sububu stated this in a chat with the Daily Trust.
“It (agreement) has been breached. You have asked for armistice, an agreement was reached but you left that person in a forest with a gun and nothing to substitute.
“What do you expect? How do you want that person to survive? All the promises made to us, none of it was fulfilled.
“Enrol the young ones in school…we should be treated the same way. Give them jobs with the government, put them in schools.
“The President should personally come and preside over the talks. When he was campaigning, he traveled all over, why would he not do it now?”
According to him, Buhari does not take these peace talks seriously as people are being killed everyday.
Sububu further demanded that the Hausa, Yoruba and the Fulani be treated the same way.
