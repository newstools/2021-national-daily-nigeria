Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar on Friday advocated the need for state governments to be empowered to control internal security within their jurisdictions. Atiku decried the kidnapping of secondary school girls on Zamfara State by bandits, appealing for general support for the Zamfara State government at this trial time.
Atiku in a statement lamented: “My heart is very heavy over the abduction of our young daughters from Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, Zamfara State.
“I have had a phone conversation with the Governor of Zamfara, Bello Matawalle, and I am informed that his government is doing everything in its power to secure the release of the abducted students.”
The former vice president stated that he had previously made recommendations on how the nation can defeat enemies of the state and win the war on terror, adding: “I stand by those suggestions.”
He said that however, all hands must be on deck to support the Zamfara State government in securing the release of those school girls abducted by bandits.
“The Federal Government cannot expect the states to provide security of life and property in their domain, without giving them control over internal security. This is now a necessity.
“Thus, I call on the National and State Assemblies to begin the process of constitutional and legal reforms that will make this a reality. The Legislature must take the lead, as it seems the Executive may not be able to provide the needed leadership on this issue.
“My heart goes out to the families of the abducted children, and my right hand of fellowship is extended to Governor Matawalle, to help in any way possible,” Atiku declared.
