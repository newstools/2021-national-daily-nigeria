A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the CBN to unfreeze the accounts of 20 #EndSARS protesters.
The apex bank froze these bank accounts after the October #EndSARS protests against police brutality and bad governance in the country.
Justice Ahmed Mohammed ruled on Wednesday after the legal teams of the CBN and the defendants agreed to end the case.
The finances of the protest organisers were targeted as funds poured in from within and outside Nigeriaâ€”to keep the daily rally going.
