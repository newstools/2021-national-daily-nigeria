A governor at the weekend signed an act of the legislature into law which allows the possession of firearms by citizens without permit.  National Daily gathered that the Governor of Utah in the United States of America at the weekend signed aa Act into law to permit people to carry concealed gun in the state without a permit. The enactment is perceived to have increased the freedom of the people and opportunity for self-defence.
Governor Spencer Cox, a Republican, was cited to have acknowledged that, “With the passage of this bill, Utah joins 17 other states with some form of permitless concealed carry.”
He highlighted: “This bill protects Second Amendment rights, reduces permitless open carry (which is already legal), and includes significant funding for suicide prevention.”
Republican State representative in the state legislature, Walt Brooks, an NRA member, was identified as the sponsor of the bill, known as House Bill 60. The Act prescribes that any individual who is 21 or above “and may lawfully possess a firearm, may carry a concealed firearm in a public area without a permit”.
Multiple gun rights were said to have requested the governor to sign the legislation into law.
A Utah official was said to have revealed that the state data shows that over 26,000 concealed carry permits in the 4th quarter of 2020 were issued, in addition to the 18,095 that were renewed. It was also highlighted that as of December 31, 2020, there were 718,218 valid concealed carry permits in the state, including some 290,000 for Utah residents and 427,639 for nonresidents.
