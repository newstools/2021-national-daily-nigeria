Traders and residents of Brighter Road, Minna, Niger, exacted their justice Tuesday morning following the destruction of their shops, homes, and businesses by the stateâ€™s Urban Development Board clearing illegal structures in the capital city.
While bulldozers tore down the structures, the people were watching in pain only to find out a building belonging to the states deputy governor in the vicinity marked for clearing was spared.
Angered by the partiality, the residents stormed the building and destroyed it.
Justifying their action, the angry mob told reporters their businesses and structure were destroyed without the owners have enough time to move out their valuables worth millions of naira, including cash.
But the acting general manager of the board said the allegation was baseless.
According to him, the owners of illegal structures in the area were duly served with notification.
