Former Kaduna Senator and other notable Nigerians have lambasted Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauch state over a statement credited to him defending Fulani herdsmen who carry AK-47 rifles.
It would be recalled that the governor had on Thursday defended armed Fulani herders, saying that the herders have no option but to carry AK-47 to defend themselves and their cattle from rustlers.
“The Fulani man is practicing the tradition of trans-human, pastoralism, he has been exposed to the battery of the forests, the animals, and now, the cattle rustlers, who carry guns, kill him and take away his commonwealth – that is his cows – he had no option than to carry Ak-47 because the society and the government are not protecting him,” Mohammed said.
Reacting to the statement, former Kaduna Central Senator, Shehu Sani in a twitter message said the governor’s justification for Fulani herdsmen to carry AK-47 amounts to baptizing infamy.
“My Brother, Bauchi Governor’s justification for AK47 amounts to baptizing infamy.”
Also reacting, National Publicity Secretary, Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin said Mohammed’s comment was unfortunate, saying that he was only justifying the crimes being committed by the herders, adding that “they know what they are doing.”
According to Kemi Yesufu, “Anyone still playing politics with the violent crimes committed by this breed of Fulani herdsmen is dangerously unintelligent.
“A serious country would long have declared these herdsmen terrorists and enemies of the state, same for the bandits operating up north.”
According to Dr. Dipo Awojide on Twitter, “Bala Mohammed is openly defending Fulani herdsmen who carry AK-47. I didn’t hear him condemn killings. He is speaking the minds of a lot of influential decision makers. That exactly is where the problem is and why it doesn’t look like they are ready for a solution any time soon.”
