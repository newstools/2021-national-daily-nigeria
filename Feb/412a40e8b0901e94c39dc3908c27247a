MultiChoice Nigeria has ruled out the possibility of implementing pay-as-go in the pay television industry in the country, noting that such a subscription model would neither work for its DStv nor its GOtv services.
Chief Customer Officer, Martin Mabutho, who spoke while announcing price slash on its DStv and GOtv decoders starting on Monday, said the billing model has no empirical practice anywhere, adding that it is not only technically impracticable, but also contractually cumbersome.
Mabutho said it is not a question of wanting to implement it, but also its workability. He likened it to playing a football match and one team scoring and people asking for refund because some 45,000 supporters of the losing club would exit the stadium and dared anybody with information about where the subscription model is working in the world to say it.
Speaking on the price slash, he said it would see the DStv HD decoder, dish kit with Compact package subscription drop from N18,600 to N9,900 on Confam package, while GOtv decoder, GOtennae with GOtv Jolli package subscription will go down from N8,400 to N6,900.
Mabutho said the price slash was part of MultiChoice’s efforts to lessen the economic impact of COVID on customers and a reflection of its commitment to making quality entertainment more accessible to Nigerians.
“With this discount, we are lowering the entry barrier for new customers to get a DStv or GOtv decoder as staying connected to credible information and other quality programming can be comforting for many families during these trying times.
“In addition to the discount we are running our DStv Step Up offer which gives our customers on lower packages an opportunity to experience programming on higher packages, and a GOtv Max offer, which sees customers on Jolli and Jinja enjoy a special discount of N2,999 instead of N3,600 per month,” Mabutho added.
