The security crisis in northern Nigeria has continued to aggravate despite the appointment of new services chiefs for the Nigerian military by President Muhammadu Buhari. Bandits defy the new security structure and sustained their mayhem without restraint.
Armed bandits launched fresh attack in Dundu Village, Bassa Local Government Area, Plateau State, where they killed two persons. It was gathered that the attack occurred in the early hours of Wednesday; one of the victims was said to have died on the spot in the violent operation. The bandits were said to have shot the victim who was ambushed; the bandits also shot the second victim, inflicting serious injuries on him and he died on the way to the hospital.
The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Plateau State Police Command, ASP Gabriel Ubah, as well as the National President of the IRIGWE Development Association, Sunday Abdu, were said to have confirmed the bandit’s onslaught in Jos.
The deceased were identified to include a 39-year-old Raphael Bawa, who has two wives and four children, as well as 40-year-old Mabo Agah, who died on the way to the hospital. Agah was said to have a wife and five children.
The renewed attack in Plateau State merely reinforces the intractable killings by bandits in the northwest, essentially, Kaduna, in the north central.
The Nigerian security operatives appear overwhelmed by the bandits beside the Boko Haram theorists in the northeast. In the south, Fulani herdsmen are causing nightmare for citizens. However, communities and regional groups are beginning to rise to resist the Fulani herdsmen invaders. The situation is gradually raising tension of ethnic and religious wars in Nigeria.
