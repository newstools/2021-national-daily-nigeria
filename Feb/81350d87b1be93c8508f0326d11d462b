The Lagos State House of Assembly was hit by mass action at the weekend by forces from Lekki. This time, the protesters. Though from Lekki, were not part of the #EndSARS movement.  
It was gathered that residents of the Oke-Egan Community, Kayetoro in Eleko area of Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, held peaceful protest at the Lagos State House of Assembly on Friday. They were at the Assembly to demand compensation for the demolition of their houses by officials of the Lagos State physical planning authority.
The protesters from Oke-Egan Community, displaying placards with different inscriptions, agitated that about 400 of their houses were demolished in the early hours of Monday by the Lagos State Government.
Leader of the protesters, Etim Odiase, was said to have complained that the people were never served any notice, and that they only heard of the issue through government announcement.
Hon. Lukmon Olumoh, representing Ajerom/Ifelodun, on behalf of the Speaker of the Assembly, had promised the protesters that the House would address their grievances, appealing to them for calm. The lawmaker assured the protesters that once it is confirmed that they were lawful owners of the demolished houses, they will be compensated.
