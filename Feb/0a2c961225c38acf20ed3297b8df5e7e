The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday halted the altercation between Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State on the arming of Fulani herdsmen with AK-47. The party frowned at the two PDP governors carrying the burden of President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) government.
The PDP in several Tweets on Monday on its official handle enjoined the two governors to be calm.
The PDP in the tweets declared:  “@OfficialPDPNig assures that it has waded into the rift between Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, and his Benue State counterpart, Governor Samuel Ortom.
“@OfficialPDPNig calls for calm as the internal reconciliation mechanism introduced by the hierarchy of the party between the two governors subsists.
“PDP however urges the Federal Government to take urgent steps to address the escalated security challenges in our country.”
 
Governor Ortom had earlier on Monday chided Governor Mohammed on his support for terrorism and arming of Fulani herdsmen, chastising Governor Mohammed of being a terrorist because of his endorsement of herdsmen carrying AK-47 to defend themselves.
