Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo has decried the level of corruption in the state’s healthcare system, describing it as a deliberate act to run down the system.
Mr. Obaseki, who stated this in Benin on Sunday at a town hall meeting with health practitioners, explained, “I have seen corruption like never before in the healthcare system. The level of corruption in the healthcare system in the state is alarming and unacceptable. We have drawn the line; it will no longer be business as usual.
“It’s left to you to either join us or take a bow honourably.”
The governor queried the modality of having just one doctor in Igarra, the Akoko Edo Local Government Area headquarters, and two in Auchi.
“Patients in these areas visit private hospitals because they have lost faith in our system. On no account should any doctor refuse posting. For the past 10 months now, I have had opportunity of discussing the healthcare system in the state. It is so clear that the system has collapsed.
“I have information to this effect. We have no choice, but to move forward and collectively, we must improve the system and make the people trust the system again.
“We have come to the end of the road of the old order, and now we must chart a new course for a better and improved healthcare system in Edo state,” he said.
Mr. Obaseki charged the doctors to justify their salaries, claiming that some earn more than he earns as a governor.
“Every doctor must now account for what they do to justify their salaries; we must be up and doing as some of you earn twice more than me, who is the governor of the state.
“You have to provide good healthcare system for Edo people; we must improve our healthcare system. I will put my life on the line for Edo people. Their health is important to me and worth dying for. They voted me into power,” he stressed.
