Bandits have released scores of schoolchildren they kidnapped in the Government Science College, Kagara, Niger State last Wednesday.
The abductors came around 2 am on Wednesday, and invaded the school, taking away 27 pupils and 15 staff members.
One of the students was killed.
Schools in the state have been shut down since.
While the effort to secure the kids freedom was on, kidnappers in Zamfara struck again. They kidnapped 300 schoolgirls in another government college at Jangebe.
The state has also shut down all schools.
