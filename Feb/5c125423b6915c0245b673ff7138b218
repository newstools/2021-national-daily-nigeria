Former governor of Anambra state, Peter Obi, has decried the spate of insecurity in the country, noting that Nigeria’s economic growth is at the mercy of criminal elements who have discouraged local investors from driving the economy forward.
The erstwhile vice-presidential candidate of the PDP who disclosed this while appearing on The Morning Show on Arise Television on Tuesday, said one of the most urgent issues the country need to address is the issue of insecurity.
“Aside from scaring away the much needed Foreign Direct Investment, high levels of insecurity as we have today, discourages local investors from driving the economy forward.
Obi called on the newly appointed service chiefs to aggressively tackle the menace of insecurity ravaging different parts of the nation.
