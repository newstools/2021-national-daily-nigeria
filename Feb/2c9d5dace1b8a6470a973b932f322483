Some youths are mobilizing others to stage a counter-protest against the one planned for the Lekki tollgate on Saturday—in reaction to the re-opening.
Five of the nine members on the Lagos judicial panel on ENDSARS riot moved for the opening of the facility last Saturday in, response to the consistent request of the Lekki Concessionaire Company.
But some youths under the hashtag OccupyLekkiTollGate took to Twitter to call for a protest against the reopening of the tollgate.
Then another group tagged #DefendLagos and #DemNoBornYourPapaWell launched their hashtags.
The two protests will be holding at the same place and the same time.
“Let us protect what the destroyers left behind while we rebuild Lagos. Join the ‘defend Lagos’ rally at the Lekki toll plaza,” a message on the poster read with pictures of destructed buildings and other facilities during the violence that followed the #EndSARS protest in the state.
The counter-rally tweets have since been trending as promoters vow to resist another protest.
The Chief Press Secretary to the Lagos State Governor, Gboyega Akosile, has reacted to the planned protest slated for Saturday, February 13, 2020, against the reopening of the Lekki tollgate in the state.
Reacting to the planned protest, Akosile, in response to a tweet with the hashtag #DontLetThemBringLagosDown, said “nobody will bring our dear Lagos State down! Their rights end where other people’s rights begin.”
