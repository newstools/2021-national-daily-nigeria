Nigeran youths on Saturday defied threats by the federal government which had on Thursday threatened the youths against the protest at Lekki Toll Gate which the government considered may be violence, ordering the participants to cancel the protest.
“At this time, the chances that any peaceful protest will be hijacked are very high. Any resort to violence in the name of #EndSARS will not be tolerated this time,” the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed had threatened.
The Lagos State government also went on wide campaign to discourage youths to participate in the protest, urging parents not to allow their children participate in the Lekki Toll Gate protest on Saturday. The Lagos government had earlier threatened that the protest will not be tolerated; but later changed it tone in a bid to discourage mass participation.
However, the protest went as planned and the police commenced arrest of participants in the Lekki Toll Gate protest.
The police had on Friday demonstrated a show-of-force to communicate their strong opposition to the planned protest.
However, as the protest commenced and the police began arrest of participants, more youths were provoked to come out enmass and join the protest. they challenged the police that they do not have the facility that can take 100,000 inmates or more at a time in Lagos State. The message trended on social media, inspiring more youths to rise for the protest and join their mates.
However, the protest was peaceful. It could not be confirmed if the mass action will continue Sunday and onward.
