Students of Ebonyi State University (EBSU) on Thursday barricaded the Abakaliki-Enugu Expressway in Ebpnyi State in protest of the overcrowding of hall when they were writing examination on Wednesday.
The students expressed their frustration that there was a stampede in the examination hall which led to fainting spells in some students as they wrote their General Studies Tests (GST) examination at the university hall.
Chairman of ASUU branch in EBSU, Dr. Ikechukwu Igwenyi, had confirmed that there was actually a stampede at the examination centre on Wednesday.
According to him, “The protest is as a result of what happened during their exams on Wednesday.’
Igwenyi, however, remarked that he cannot give the number of students that had the fainting spells during the examination.
The Police Public Relations Officer of the Ebonyi Command, Loveth Odah, briefed journalists that the Command is on top of the situation to ensure security on the campus.
 
“The police are aware of the matter. The Commissioner, Aliyu Garba, has sent officers to the scene and they are yet to bring back reports,’’ Ms. Odah said.
Some of the students expressed displeasure at the overcrowding of students in a small hall to write examinations.
Kelechi Nworie, a student, said it was pertinent to provide bigger halls for students to avoid a repeat.
“It is very worrisome and up till now the university does not have a functional healthcare centre.
“Some students collapsed during the examination due to overcrowding that caused the stampede.
“Some were rushed to the hospital, but we have not heard about their health situation.
“The protest is peaceful; we are only out to register our anger. Some students could not write the examination, which has been cancelled,’’ Nworie said.
Another student, Janet Ogbonna, decried the situation saying the university environment was not conducive for learning.
