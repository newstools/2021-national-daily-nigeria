Bandits in the early hours of Friday kidnapped over 300 students of the Government Girls Secondary School in Jangebe Local Government Area of Zamfara State. The bandits were said to have invaded the school at about 1.00am on Friday and forced the students out of the hostels and taking them to unknown destination.
The mass kidnapping of the students is coming at a time the Zamfara State governor is celebrating repentant bandits and disbursing money in millions to claimed repentant bandits.
However, there may not be any cause for alarm as an Islamic teacher, Sheikh Gumi, could be on to negotiate and secure the release of the kidnapped students having developed good relationship with bandits in the north.
Details of the Friday kidnapping later.
