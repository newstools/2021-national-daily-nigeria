The United Kingdom has thrown more lights on its latest directives which black-listed citizens of some countries from entering the country as part of measures to curb spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.
According to the UK’s Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock, Nigerians are not among the 33 countries that will face tough COVID-19 new measures on arrival to its shores.
The countries affected by the new measures are: The countries affected are: Angola; Argentina; Bolivia; Botswana; Brazil; Burundi; Cape Verde; Chile; Colombia; DRC; Ecuador; Eswatini; French Guiana; Lesotho; Malawi; Mauritius; Mozambique; Namibia and Panama
He said the new measures which take effect from Monday, will see UK residents returning to England from the countries on the list pay £1,750 to quarantine in a Government-approved hotel.
‘Passengers will only be able to enter the UK through a small number of ports that currently account for the vast majority of passenger arrivals,’ Mr Hancock told the House of Commons.
‘When they arrive they will be escorted to a designated hotel which will be closed to guests who aren’t quarantining, for 10 days, or for longer if they test positive for Covid-19 during their stay.
“All passengers must book and pay for their ‘quarantine package’ online via a booking system, which will go live on Thursday, before they travel.
The fee will cover the hotel stay for 10 days, transport to the accommodation, and Covid-19 testing.
Mr Hancock said 16 hotels have so far been contracted with 4,600 rooms available but more will be secured in the coming days.
