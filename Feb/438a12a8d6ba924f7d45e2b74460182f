Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church in Lagos Pastor Tunde Bakare has advised Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to get off the seat if he is not allowed to function in the President Muhammadu Buhari government.
In an Instagram interview Ovation publisher Dele Momodu on Tuesday night, Bakare said, “I do not know if that statement is true that he is not allowed to perform because the constitution is very clear on what the role of the vice-president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is, especially as it relates to steering the economy of the nation.”
Citing his own agreement with Buhari when he was his sidekick in the 2011 presidential election, Bakare said he asked Buhari then what role would he play.
“I said what would be my role because I am not prepared to be a spare tyre and he said to me that my role will be as prescribed by the constitution and as many other things as you can be given to do,” he said.
Bakare, however, said it would be better to hear from the horse’s mouth-that is from Osinbjo himself if he is really been rendered redundant as vice president.
“I don’t like rumour and I don’t like gossip. If he is not allowed to perform, I would wonder what he is still doing there because he is not allowed to perform,” said Bakare.
