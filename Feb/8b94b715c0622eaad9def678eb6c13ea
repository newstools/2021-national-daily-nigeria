The Federal Government through the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has debunked it has approved an alleged individual National Identification Number (NIN) registration website.
In a statement on the official twitter handle of NIMC on Monday, the commission said the website is not associated with NIMC.
While warning Nigerians not to become victims and to protect their personal information, the NIMC disclosed that the website (http://bit.ly/NIN-ONLINE-REGISTRATION) is run by fraudsters.
“Disclaimer. The website is not associated with NIMC. It is run by fraudsters. Protect your personal information, do not become a victim,” it stated.
