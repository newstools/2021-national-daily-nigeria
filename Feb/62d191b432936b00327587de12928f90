The return of Ekiti former Gov. Segun Oni to the PDP, in preparation for the 2022 guber election, has hit resistance as ex-Gov Ayo Fayose is ready to upset everything.
Fayose has endorsed his own faction’s chairman Bisi Kolawole as the party’s candidate, dumping his former deputy and the 2018 candidate Olusola Eleka.
The former governor’s choice has thus compounded things for other hopefuls, including Oni, Eleka, and Deji Ogunsakin who had thought they would get Fayose’s blessing.
Kolawole was in Ekiti’s third assembly, representing the  Efon Constituency between 2007 and 2011. He also served under Fayose as Commissioner for Environment between 2015 and 2018.
The opposition in Ekiti has been fractured since the APC took over in 2018. Fayose’s faction dominated by his group Osoko Peoples Assembly is in supremacy war with Sen. Abiodun Olujimi’s.
All efforts by the PDP national leadership to resolve the crisis have failed.
