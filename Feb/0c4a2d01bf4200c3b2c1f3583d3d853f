A medical expert, Dr. Oluwashina Salami, has warned that shortage of water in the body can be detrimental to human health and may even lead to death.
Dr. Salami, a Senior Registrar at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, made this disclosure during a medical sensitisation workshop for the 2020 Batch B stream 2 and Batch A corps members at the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Orientation Camp, Ede, Osun State.
According to him, “the importance of water to the human body cannot be over-emphasized. That is why researches disclosed that the body is composed of 66 percent water. In order to maintain that, it is advisable to take an average of 2.5 litres of water daily.
“Without taking water, the body will lose water through various means like sweating, urinating and defecating. There is a need to always take water even when you’re not tasty. 8 cups of water is what is recommended daily to keep the balance of water in the body.”
He explained that body pains, dizziness, indigestion, constipation and headache may arise if there is shortage of water in the body system.
