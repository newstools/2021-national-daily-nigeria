Bandits have sustained their siege in Kaduna State, perpetuating their violence trade without restraint. Bandits on Saturday struck in Igabi Local Government Area, Kaduna State, killing a man and his son in the operation.
The Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in Kaduna State, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement, acknowledged the attack and killings. He narrated that the bandits invaded Baka village in Igabi Local Government in the early hours of Saturday, where they attacked the residence of the victims, shooting sporadically.
The commissioner said that the bandits, in an attempt to kidnap one Sanusi Musa, a farmer in the village, after gaining access into his compound, shot both the man and his son to death.
Over 23 people were killed in five local government areas of Kaduna State by bandits about one week ago.
Governor Nasir El-Rufai has expressed sadness over the attacks and condoled the family of the slain father and son, while offering prayers for the repose of their souls.
