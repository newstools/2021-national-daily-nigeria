The Merseyside club have endured some difficult moments lately. Not only have their 68 unbeaten game record at Anfield shattered by Burnley three weeks ago.
Strangely and more agonizingly, Liverpool have gone ahead to lose all two of their following games at Anfield after slumping to 0-1 and 1-3 defeats to Brighton and Manchester City respectively.
The bitter fact of the above incidents have left the emotional Jurgen Klopp in pains as he has seen his fearsome side gradually jeopardizing their slim chances of retaining their English Premier League (EPL) title as they presently sit fourth on the EPL table after slipping 10 points behind leaders Manchester City who have a game in hand.
More sorrowfully, the Liverpool manager has seen his pain heightened with the passing away of his beloved mother Elisabeth Klopp.
National Daily gathered that Jurgen Klopp revealed the news of his mother’s death while paying tribute to her in a German newspaper Schwarzwaelder Bote . The Liverpool boss explained that his mother meant everything to him.
“She was a real mum in the best sense of the word. As a devout Christian, I know she is in a better place now.”
Sadly for the former Borussia Dortmund boss, he was unable to travel to German for his mother’s funeral due to pandemic-related travel issues National Daily further learnt.
Klopp added: “The fact that I can’t be at the funeral is due to the terrible times. As soon as the circumstances allow, we will hold a wonderful commemoration that is appropriate to it.”
Elisabeth, who got married to Klopp’s dad Norbert in 1960, had three children with her late husband: Stefanie, Isolde and the youngster, Jurgen.
These are definitely some painful moments for Jurgen Klopp.
