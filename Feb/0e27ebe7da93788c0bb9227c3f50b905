The female teenage student who was caught in school with a gun has confessed to being a cultist, and that she got the gun from her boyfriend, Okon Effingham, who is married with six kids.
She told journalists while being paraded at the weekend that her boyfriend, who she has been intimate with since August 2020, is the owner of the gun.
It would be recalled that the teenage girl, a student of Government Secondary School in Ikot Ewa, Cross River State was during the week caught with a gun in the classroom, and was initially claimed that she took the gun to school to shoot her teacher for asking her to cut her coloured hair.
However, following her arrest, police discovered she was taking the locally made double barrel pistol to a blacksmith.
Speaking at the Police Command Headquarters, Diamond Hill, Calabar, when she was paraded alongside her boyfriend who owns the locally made pistol and 11 others for various crimes, she said: “I am a member of Sky Queen Confraternity, I am just an ordinary member, I don’t hold any position in the group, I have known the owner of the gun who is my man-friend since last year, he sleeps with me and supports me with little things, but he is not the one paying my school fees.
“My mother knows about him because he visits me at our house and sometimes he sleeps over at my place because I have my own room, then in the morning he goes back to his own house.”
The boyfriend to the schoolgirl, Okon Effiong said while being paraded: “I am a married man with six children, I did not give her the gun, she took it herself where I kept it under the bed.
Briefing Journalists on Friday, Cross River Commissioner of police, Sikiru Akande, said that investigation was ongoing to unravel the mystery surrounding the ownership of the gun, adding that Okon Effiong has been arrested and more details would be made known soon.
