The Speaker of the Kwara State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Danladi, has fired his media aide, Ibrahim Sheriff-Gold, for participating in the fracas that disrupted the stakeholders meeting of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ilorin, Kwara State.
It was disclosed that Ibrahim Sheriff-Gold, a member of the Lukman Mustapha media crew, does not hide his hatred for the Kwara State Governor. The Speaker had sacked him after a video footage exposed his participation in the violent disruption of the party’s meeting prior to the commencement of the APC revalidation and registration exercise in Kwara State.
The Speaker was said to be furious after sighting Sheriff-Gold in the video participating in the shameful violence after warnings not to get involved in party conflicts.
