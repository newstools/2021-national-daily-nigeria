For his tribal activism, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, is now £9, 320  (N4.8 million) richer, and more quid still coming his way as the Yoruba nation in the Diaspora kick in more fund to support his cause: to rid the southwest of violent Fulani herders.
Supporters of this crusade set up a Gofundme page for the purpose of raising £100,000 (N51.8m) for him to buy buses to make it happen.
The fundraiser was initiated by Maureen Badejo, a blogger and activist based in the United Kingdom.
So far, £9, 320 (N4.8m) has been raked up within 15 hours.
Funnellling funds from abroad to push local domestic agitation worries the President Muhammadu Buhari government. It shut down a similar drive by the Feminine Coalition during the October ENDSARS protest. Many of the recipients were branded terrorists, and their accounts were frozen.
The DSS has been warning of ethnic and religion upheavals, and the agency is , no doubt, monitoring the Sunday Igboho development.
But his supporters express their support cash-wise because they want Yorubaland free of Fulani criminals terrorizing the people.
Igboho shot into the media space after turfing out a Fulani leader suspected to be complicit in criminal activities in Igangan, and other towns in Ibarapaland, Oyo. He moved to Ogun early in the week to chase out another Fulani crime lord.
For now, he is more like a one-man army, are-handed, though ‘fortified’ with charms bulging under his clothes. He also has a bunch of youth cheering him on.
The governors, including his state’s Seyi Makinde, Ogun’s Dapo Abiodun, in the region have yet to buy into his cause.
