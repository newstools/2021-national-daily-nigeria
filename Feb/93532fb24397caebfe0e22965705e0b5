President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday said those behind the incessant herdsmen/farmers clash and ethnic violence in the country are a few people with resources and influence who are fanning the embers of violence just to realize their own selfish political goals.
Buhari who spoke in Abuja when he received a delegation of Borno/Yobe Elders Forum on a courtesy call, vowed to identify and deal with them very soon.
According to him, the stability of the country is of paramount interest to him and the Federal Government will continue to work towards it despite the actions of a few people.
“I am confident that we will eventually convince the small number of people with resources and influence that are a nuisance to this great country. God willing, we will identify them, and deal with them. I am extremely concerned about your constituency like the rest of the country.”
.Professor Babagana Zulum, Governor of Borno State, said the leaders were in Abuja to thank the President for the tremendous improvement in their states and to intimate him with some of the prevailing socio-economic conditions.
Also speaking at the event, Architect Ibrahim Bunu and Gambo Gubio expressed appreciation to the President as well as the armed forces for their commitment and sacrifices in bringing a new lease of life to the Northeast.
They requested for completion of long-standing infrastructure and on-going projects in the states, especially roads.
They also called on the President to continue oil exploration in the Chad Basin initiated when he was the Minister of Petroleum in the 70s and the recharging of Lake Chad which the President is passionate about.
Also on the delegation were Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, former Governor Kashmir Shettima of Borno State, as well as senators, traditional rulers and elders in the two states.
