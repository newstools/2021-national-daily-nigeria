APC national leader Bola Tinubu has revealed how the late Lateef Jakande, the first civilian governor of Lagos, turned down request to contest presidential elections.
“Jakande refused to become president. He said ‘I don’t want to be president in the midst of chaos’: Tinubu said during the Friday Fidau prayer for Jakande.
“We are lucky to draw from his fountain of wisdom and knowledge.
“We can’t beat his records because he is already a martyr but we will pursue our dreams and mission with our vision,” Tinubu said.
Jakande in his lifetime was hailed a man of integrity and discipline, having remained non-partisan since he left politics decades ago.
He passed away last Thursday morning in Lagos at the age of 91.
