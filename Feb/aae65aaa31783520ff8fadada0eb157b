One of the northern thought leaders and the most tireless critics of President Muhammadu Buhari, a second republic lawmaker Junaid Mohammed is dead.
His brother Ahmed Salik confirmed the death to DAILY NIGERIAN on Thursday night.
Some sources said he died at an isolation center in Kano after testing positive to COVID-19.
Mohammed served in the federal House of Reps when Buhari snatched power as military head of state in 1983—when he dissolved the National Assembly.
Junaid trained as a medical doctor in the USSR, and came to serve as a rep later, and on board of OMPADEC during former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration.
He was the running mate of the SDP candidate in the 2019 presidential election.
Aso Rock will remember Mohammed for his consistent criticism of Buhari for nepotism and bad governance because of Buhari’s health.
Mohammed is survived by a wife and four children.
He died at 71.
