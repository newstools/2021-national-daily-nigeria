The Chief of Defence Staff, Major General Lucky Irabor, on Sunday refuted reports that escapee Chibok girls are in the custody of the military. Irabor declared that no escaped Chibok Girl is in the custody of the country’s military.
Chief of Defence Staff had on Sunday visited the operational Headquarters, Command and Control Centre of Operation Lafiya Dole in Maiduguri, Borno State, with other Service Chiefs, for on-the-spot evaluation of the military battle to end Boko Haram terrorism in the northeast Nigeria. On that visit, Major General Irabor noted that contrary to reports in the public, there are no new set of escaped Chibok girls in the custody of the Nigerian military.
He, however, expressed the anticipation of the military that the remaining Chibok girls in the captivity of the Boko Haram terrorists regain their freedom.
“We desire that the rest of the Chibok Girls receive their liberty and if our operations have helped these ones to escape, if it yielded such results, then we are glad,” Major General Irabor had said. He added that more efforts are being made to strengthen the military, hoping the efforts will yield desired results.
