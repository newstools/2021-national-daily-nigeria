Nollywood has again lost one of its vets , Victor Decker, who was found dead in his apartment on Monday by his neighbours at about 5 pm.
Mayor of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, Abuja, Jesse Nazareth, confirmed the incident.
While the cause of his death is unknown yet, Nazareth said the body has been embalmed as he was already bloated before the neighbor brought down his door and found him in his sitting room.
“They went to his house, knocked on his door but got no response so they had to break down the door. That was when they saw him sitting on his chair lifeless,’ Nazareth explained.
“He was already smelling as he was decomposing. I rushed down there to arrange the necessary things.”
All the hospitals she took the remains refused to admit it.
“I had to obtain a police report and cars to convey him to a hospital. I took him to several hospitals but they rejected him because his body was already decomposing. At about 3 am this morning, we were referred to a private hospital in Bwari, Abuja, where they accepted his body. This morning, they are embalming his body but they need to first reduce its size as he has swollen.”
Decker starred in films like Double Strings, If I am President and Lotanna.
He was 72.
