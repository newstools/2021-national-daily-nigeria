After a brief power tussle that went nearly physical between Imo Gov Hope Uzodinma and his predecessor Sen. Rochas Okorocha, the police have spoken out on the release of the arrested senator and his aides who broke into a confiscated property.
The state government said Okorocha lost his bowel control that Sunday, visiting loo many times, and had to be released.
However, the Imo State Government on Monday gave reasons why Okorocha, was let off the hook at the state Police Command around 11.30 pm on Sunday.
The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said the release of Okorocha didn’t mean he won’t answer for “the offence he committed.”
But Okorocha has reacted.
According to him , the Presidency intervened in the matter.
He warned that Uzodimma might not end well as a governor because he has dumped governance for the shadows.
The state government has been taken over state properties it claims were taken over by the Okorochas.
