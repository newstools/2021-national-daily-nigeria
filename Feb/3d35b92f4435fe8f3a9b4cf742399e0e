The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, had on Wednesday said that President Muhammadu Buhari has shown greater accommodation and tolerance of human rights violations in Nigeria.
Malami in a media interaction in Abuja declared: “As far as Human Rights records of the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is concerned, the fact speaks for itself, the commendation by the international body which is the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, local compliance with the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission, which has been unprecedented, tolerance and indeed, accommodation for the excesses of the #EndSARS protesters were all facts that go to establish a point that the government of President Buhari has shown greater accommodation of the human rights violation and the tolerance to the human rights record as far as the Nigerian State is concerned.”
Malami maintained that President Buhari tolerated the ‘excesses’ of #EndSARS protesters in the country back in October 2020. That, among other actions of the president, is proof of his leniency, despite the “human rights violations” in the country, Malami said.
The Justice Minister declared: “no nation in the world could have tolerated the idea of destruction to its security institutions.
“I think over 20 police stations or more, I am not certain about the number, they can be more, were destroyed during #EndSARS protests and the government has a responsibility to ensure the protection of lives and freedom of movement.
“We are confronted with a situation whereby #EndSARS protesters blocked roads, caused mayhem, caused deaths, caused destruction, and they were significantly tolerated to a certain extent.”
