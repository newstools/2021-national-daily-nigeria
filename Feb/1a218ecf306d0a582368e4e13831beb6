Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State at the weekend advocated ban on movement of herdsmen and cattle from the north to the south so as to contain the spread of the killer herdsmen across Nigeria. Apparently, Governor Ganduje is recommending a legislation that would restrict or ban the movement of herdsmen and cattle from the north to the south of Nigeria. He emphasized the need to abolish the transportation or trekking of herdsmen from Northern Nigeria to the Middle Belt and to Southern Nigeria.
Governor Ganduje in a media interaction after a special lunch with President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina State, was of the view that such law would be useful to contain the recurring clashes between farmers and herdsmen and other crimes which include kidnapping that are linked to the Fulani herdsmen in several parts of the country.
The Kano governor maintained that the law will further address cattle rustling in northern Nigeria.
Governor Ganduje had declared: “My advocacy is that we should abolish the transportation or trekking of herdsmen from the Northern part of Nigeria to the Middle Belt and to the Southern part of Nigeria.
“There should be a law that will ban, otherwise, we cannot control the conflicts between herdsmen and farmers and cannot control the cattle rustling which is affecting us greatly.”
