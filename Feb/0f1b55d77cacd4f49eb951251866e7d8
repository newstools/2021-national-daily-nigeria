Manchester City have maintained a scintillating form in the English Premier League title fight.
The Etihad club have gone 16 games unbeaten since losing to Tottenham 2-0 last November. They have since gone to win their last 14 and drew only two games in their recent EPL unbeaten run.
Pep Guardiola and his men have since opened a 10-point gap them and their nearest rivals Manchester United and Leicester City.
Interestingly, City’s midfielder Rodri has revealed the secret to their success when he pinned their rampant run of form on a dressing room inquest held earlier this season National Daily gathered.
And with their current position on the top the table with a double digit advantage over their nearest challengers – and could possibly extend the gap by another three points with a win over Arsenal on Sunday going by their current awe-inspiring form.
National Daily can recall that the situation was much bleaker for City prior to their November upturn of positive form after a stuttering start to the campaign which left them languishing in 14th spot.
Speaking to Sky Sports, the Spaniard revealed: “In the first period of the season, we weren’t playing well individually and collectively but this changed once we got together and spoke more about how we could work together.
“We had a meeting and talked to each other. We analysed what was happening and how the team could do better.
We all agreed that every player could do a little bit more for the team. I feel it’s the reason why we’re doing so well right now as there are lots of players who are currently playing at an incredible level.”
And fortunately for the Etihad club, their turnaround in form has seen them fail to trail in a top flight fixture since – and, with both United and Leicester dropping points, the four-time champions look set to saunter to yet another EPL title.
