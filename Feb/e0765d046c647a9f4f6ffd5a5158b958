Some youths in Lagos have fixed February 13 for a mega rally to protest plans by the Lagos state government to reopen the Lekki tollgate which was closed last year after the #EndSARS protests.
The counter-protest was announced on Monday, shortly after some youths who rejected the reopening of the Lekki toll gate, launched a campaign called #OccupyLekkiTollGate.
The poster of counter-rally shared on social media showed that it is held at the same venue and time as the one planned by the #OccupyLekkiTollGate protesters.
The counter-rally is trending on Twitter as #DefendLagos and #DemNoBornYourPapaWell.
The #OccupyLekkiTollGate protesters are claiming that justice must be served to youths allegedly killed by soldiers during the #EndSars protest.
But #DefendLagos team insisted that Lagos State witnessed the destruction of public and private properties during the #EndSARS protest, therefore further protest that will lead to destruction will not be tolerated.
“Let us protect what the destroyers left behind while we rebuild Lagos. Join the ‘defend Lagos’ rally at the Lekki toll plaza,” a message on the poster read with pictures of destroyed buildings and other facilities during the violence that followed the #EndSARS protest in the state.
One of the promoters of the #DefendLagos protest, Olusoga Owoeye @olusogaowoeye said, “Show your love for our Lagos. Get your friends and your neighbors to be there. Join the DefendLagos Rally at the Lekki toll plaza on the 13th of February. We will not cede our city to criminals and insurrectionists. Lagos is our pride.”
“I must be there to defend Lagos. I was born in Lagos. Even though I am from Ondo State, I lived all my life in Lagos. I will never allow any miscreants to destroy Lagos again, never will it happen,” Olumide Akin @holumyne said.
However, some tweeps expressed fear that the protests may result in a bloody clash at the Lekki tollgate, urging the state government and security agencies to step in.
One of them, @AjayiWizeman, said “I am sure the #DefendLagos people will not come on Saturday and be civil. They will be dressed in the police, soldiers, and DSS uniforms alongside thugs. Dem no fit face thousands who will #OccuppyLekkiTollGate Na we set the date and time!”
@sageugo added, “This is the plot, they’ll pay some Twitter influencers to trend #DefendLagos from now till 13th February, then on the D-day, they’ll unleash the same hoodlums they used to destroy Lagos during the #ENDSARS protest for a bloody clash with the #OccuppyLekkiTollGate protesters.”
