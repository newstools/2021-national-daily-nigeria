After what he took as his peace-keeping role in the on-going Fulani-Yoruba crisis in Ibarapaland, Oyo, Ooni Adeyeye Ogunwusi might be expecting some thumbs-up. He is mistaken.
Sunday Adeyemo aka Igboho the Yoruba jingoist who sparked up the crisis with his ultimatum to Seriki Fulani of Igangan, believes the foremost Yoruba monarch goofed, especially for being dovish after the monarch visited Aso Rock in the wake of the crisis.
And Sunday Igboho is not hiding it.
According to him, the monarch failed to convey the pains and displeasure of the Yoruba people to the President Muhammadu Buhari during the visit.
“Ooni should have told Buhari the truth but he did not. When Ooni returned, he started tackling me to leave the remaining task to the government to finish. You can imagine that kind of talk?, Igboho told his virtual audience during an online meeting with the Diaspora Yoruba on Wednesday.
Ogunwusi invited Igboho to Ife, and commended his efforts to secure his people. But the monarch advised him to not take the law into his hand by chasing Fulani leaders out of Ibarapaland—when the police and Gov Seyi Makinde should be handling things.
But Igboho insisted the monarch disappointed the Yoruba people by not speaking against the killer herdsmen in the region when he met with the President.
He also accused some politicians of collusion too. Among these are the governors of the two states he has been rejected as an interventionists.
Makinde spoke decisively against the ultimatum and the outcome, urging the police to take as criminals those involved in the arson that followed the ultimatum.
Ogun Gov Dao Abiodun also rejected Igboho when he announced he was coming on invitation to tackle Fulani herders in another town in Ogun.
