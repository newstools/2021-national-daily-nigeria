The revalidation of party membership the APC going on in the party is tugging at the heart of its leaders as some publicly disagree with the promoters
Two among prominent leaders for and against the exercise happen to be among those many believe are eyeing the 2023 presidency as the tickets rotates southwest.
Both have indirectly tackled each other.
The party’s national leader Bola Tinubu believes its unnecessary and a waste of resources. The APC former interim chairman Bisi Akande equally expressed his displeasure.
But Gov. Kayode Fayemi takes an opposite view, and he challenges Akande to read the party constitution, and interpret it faithfully.
“Baba Akande is my father. And I have the greatest respect for him,’ said FRayemi on Monday.
“But I also read the party’s constitution. And I believe in article 9 of the legal framework which stipulates that the party register must be updated every six months.
“So if this is being done in total compliance with the party’s constitution, I don’t think there is anything wrong with it.”
Neither Tinubu nor Fayemi has expressed their interest to join the contest in 2023. But their paths have been at variance for a while now.
However, Akande and Tinubu have revalidated their membership at their respective wards.
