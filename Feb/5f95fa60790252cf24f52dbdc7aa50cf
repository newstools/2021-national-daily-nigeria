The former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, on Wednesday, admonished the emergent Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, whose nomination by President Muhammadu Buhari was confirmed by the Senate at plenary, to learn from the mistakes of his predecessors. Ekweremadu counseled the emergent EFCC chairman to conscious of abuse of power, telling him that his tenure is for a time after which he becomes like the Nigerian citizens on the street.
During the screening before the confirmation on Wednesday, Abdulrasheed Bawa denied selling off any assets seized by the EFCC in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Bawa revealed that the then Director of Operations and three directors and the Secretary of the commission flew into Port Harcourt to sell the confiscated vessels. He said that if he had been involved in the sales, the EFCC would have from within sanction him.
The Senate, therefore, confirmed Bawa substantive EFCC chairman. The emergent chairman brought to an end the regime of unconfirmed acting chairman presiding over the affairs and operations of the EFCC. The Ibrahim Magu tenure was replete with controversies from the beginning to the point of his exit. Magu left the EFCC unceremoniously, besides his rejection by the Senate for confirmation and his illegal continuity in office with the seeming support of the vice president. Though, nominated by President Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo sent Magu’s name to the Senate for confirmation while President Buhari was on medical holidays to the United Kingdom.
The Justice Ayo Salami presidential panel sealed Magu’s controversial chairmanship of the EFCC.
Abdulrasheed Bawa, appointed EFCC acting chairman after Magu was suspended at the beginning of the Justice Salami investigative panel. The president on February 16 requested the Senate to screen and confirm Bawa as EFCC chairman which was concluded this Wednesday.
