The National Consultative Front (NCF) at the weekend issued President Muhammadu Buhari 24 hours ultimatum to reverse the pump price of petrol from N212 to N163 or face a nationwide protest. The NCF placed members on red alert, urging them to be ready for a nationwide protest and occupy the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) Depots and fuel stations across the country, if the federal government fails to reverse the hike in pump price within the specified period.
The Head of Public Affairs of the NCF, Tanko Yakasai, in a statement explained that the ultimatum became necessary, after it was rumoured twice about the pump price increment by the Federal Government and its denial, resulting in panic-buying of the product; followed by sudden adjustment of pump price to N212.6o and N200 per litre across the country.
NCF agitated that the incident has caused untold hardship on Nigerians.
The Forum protested that the hanky panky game being played by the Federal Government, the NNPC and the petroleum marketers must be stopped.
The Forum also declared that the Buhari administration has failed to make proper consultations and give prior notice to the members of the public who are presently bearing the untold hardship imposed on them by the government. The NCF declared that “it is wicked and exploitative to increase the price of petrol pump price in Nigeria by a corrupt and self-serving cabal, running the Buhari government by proxy, as the President, himself, has been largely absent and nonexistent, since the 2019 elections was badly manipulated for him by a fading cabal at the Aso Villa.”
The Forum cautioned that “Nigerians have had enough of the lackluster performance and undue hardship foisted by the Buhari-led APC government, and hereby, demand that it steps down without delay, to avoid a calamitous uprising in the country, as Nigerians can no longer bear the pains inflicted on them, and may be compelled to occupy the Presidential Villa soon, for relief.”
