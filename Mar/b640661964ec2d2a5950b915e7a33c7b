Three unemployed men, Kenneth Bello, Monday Collins and Monday Elvis, on Tuesday, appeared before an Ejigbo Magistrate’s Court, Lagos for allegedly failing to comply with COVID-19 law.
They were specifically accused of violating the law that currently prohibits social gathering and late-night movement.
Bello, 28, Collins, 23 and Elvis, 21, are facing a five-count charge bordering on disobedience to quarantine restriction, assault and malicious damage.
They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The Prosecutor, Insp. Benedict Aigbokhan, told the court that the defendants committed the offences on Feb. 27 at 2.30 a.m. at Abule Egun, Ipaja, Lagos.
Aigbokhan said that the trio flouted the 12.00 a.m. to 4.00 a.m. restriction movement order of the Federal Government.
He said that the defendants also conducted themselves in a manner likely to breach the peace by obstructing the Anti-Crime Patrol team of Ipaja Police Station from performing their lawful duty.
“The defendants assaulted the Anti-Crime Patrol team led by Insp. Emmanuel Abumere and maliciously damaged an office table worth N35,000 belonging to Ipaja Police Station.
“The defendants were also in possession of a substance suspected to be hemp and its crushers,’’ the prosecutor said.
He said the offences contravened Section 5 of the Quarantine Act Q2, Law of the Federation 2004 and Public Health Law, Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The Magistrate, Mr E. O. Ogunkanmi, granted the defendants N200,000 bail each with two sureties each in like sum.
He ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed with an evidence of tax payments to the Lagos State Government.
Ogunkanmi adjourned the case until April 26 for a mention.
