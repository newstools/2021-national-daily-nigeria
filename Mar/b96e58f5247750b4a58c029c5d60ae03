Nigeria is fast becoming the most unsecured in the world as there was virtually no day that there is not a report of killings and abductions, says Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG.
Bamgbose in a statement on Monday said the Presidency has been crippled by these ugly events with Nigerians losing interest and confidence in President Muhammadu Buhari’s Presidency.
According to the senior lawyer, who has also declared interest to run in 2023, Nigeria is almost a jungle. “The security agents are overwhelmed. President Buhari has really not helped in assuring the citizens that there is respite at sight.
“Something urgent must be done or else the country will collapse. It’s, however, my humble view that the exit of Buhari will certainly fortify our unity.
“In essence, things may not really change for the better until we have a new government come 2023. Buhari is already exhausted. It’s only his exit from power that can give us sigh of relief. The era of sentiments has gone.
Bamgbose noted that Nigeria’s unity is currently under serious threat, pointing out that the agitations for secession has never been this strong in the entire political history of the country.
“Our unity has never been this weak. The insecurity across the nation has never helped matters. Governance has been shut down. The issue is not where you have come from but rather your ability to find a lasting solution to the intimidating challenges confronting us.
“As elected President of Nigeria, my priority will be to tackle insecurity headlong. I will only need 12 months to displace insecurity in Nigeria.”
