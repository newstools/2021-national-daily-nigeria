The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has called on sports stakeholders to support and key into the revived National Principals’ Cup Competition as it enters the zonal stages.
Dr Ademola Are, the ministry’s Director of Grassroots Sports Development, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in an interview on Thursday in Abuja that this was crucial to bringing back the glamour of the competition.
He said that the zonal finals which kicked off on Thursday in the six geo-political zones of the country would end on March 22, with teams emerging for the grand finale in Abuja.
“We want more support from stakeholders as we enter the zonal stage of the competition, because this is the best of our youth in sports and education on display,” he said.
Are who is also the Chairman, Main Organising Committee (MOC) of the competition said the expanded competition which now has football, athletics and table tennis was part of efforts to develop sports at the grassroots.
“Thirty seven secondary schools are vying for honours at the zonal finals, from where we will have 24 table tennis players, 144 athletes and six football teams qualifying for the finals in Abuja,” Are added.
NAN reports that states where the zonal finals are holding include: Kaduna (North West), Bauchi (North East), Plateau (North Central), Oyo (South West), Enugu (South East) and Edo state (South South).
He said the grand finale of the competition will hold from March 26 to March 31 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja with ex-internationals and other dignitaries in attendance.
NAN also reports that the revived National Principals Cup is an initiative of the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, aimed at grassroot sports development, especially in schools.
