The police in Oyo State on Tuesday brought six persons before a High Court in Ibadan, for allegedly defrauding Total Grace Oil and Gas Company to the tune of N19,992,401.
The defendants – Idowu Olushola, Ogundeji Gbenga, Ajisefini Abdullah, Rufai Adekunle, Olorunyomi Babatunde and Adedamola Olamilekan – are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing.
If found guilty, the charges against the defendants could attract a maximum of seven years imprisonment.
The Prosecutor,  Mr M Oje, told the court that the defendants between June 2020 and February 2021, conspired to defraud the company of the said sum.
Oje said the defendants allegedly converted a total sum of N19,992,401 belonging to Total Grace Group Ltd.  to their personal use.
He said the offences contravened Section 516 and punishable under Section 390 of the Criminal Code Cap 32 Vol.II Law of Oyo State 2000.
The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.
The prosecutor urged the court to remand the defendants at the Correctional Centre and adjourned the case, to enable him to bring his witnesses.
The counsel to the defendants, Mr Ezekiel Adeshinga and Mrs Folake Ajayi, urged the court to grant bail to their clients on most liberal terms.
Ajayi said the defendants had been in police custody in the last seven days, which was against the 24 hours provided by the law.
According to her, the defendants are presumed innocent until proved otherwise, adding that the charges against them are bailable.
Justice Mashud Abas granted bail to the defendants in the sum of N5 million each with two sureties in like sum.
Abas said the sureties must reside within the jurisdiction of the court while one of them must have a landed property and as well sworn to an affidavit of means.
He adjourned the case until April 13 for hearing.
