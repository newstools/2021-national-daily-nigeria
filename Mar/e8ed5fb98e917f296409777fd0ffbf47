A Grade I Area Court in Dutse, Abuja on Tuesday sentenced a 22-year- old man, Yusuf Rabiu, to two months imprisonment for stealing household items.
Delivering judgment, the Presiding Officer, Mr Hassan Aliyu held that the convict failed to give the court a reasonable explanation why some stolen items were found in his possession.
Aliyu, however, gave the convict an option to pay a fine of N30,000
Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Mrs Idowu Ojo told the court that the matter was first reported at the Bwari Police Station in Oct.7, 2020 by Chebazawa Philip of Area 1, in Bwari.
Ojo said that sometime in 2020, Rabiu broke into a room in the Philip’s compound in Bwari and stole household items.
However, he said, the convict escaped without being caught.
He also said that the convict made a second attempt in the same house but was caught while attempting to steal a basin filled with clothes and spoons.
The prosecution said that the convict admitted to the crimes during police investigation  and items worth N15, 000 were recovered from him.
The offence, he said, contravened  the provisions of sections 346 and 287 of the Penal Code.
The convict pleaded guilty to the offence and begged the court for leniency.
