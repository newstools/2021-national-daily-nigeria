A member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Oladimeji Fabiyi, on Friday declared that the party did not lose the 2015 election because of zoning but because of betrayal of the party at the highest level.
Fabiyi on Channels Television on Friday morning monitored from Lagos, said that many PDP leaders were not comfortable with former President Goodluck Jonathan and did not want him to return for a second tenure. He said that former President Jonathan did well, adding that the former president did his best, reiterating that many PDP members worked against his re-election. Fabiyi, however, said that the PDP has gone beyond that, and is evolving towards building new political culture in the country.
Fabiyi expressed support for the controversial recommendation of one of the PDP reforms committee that recommended consideration for merit in nominating the PDP presidential candidate for the 2023 elections. Invariably, the PDP has since the recommendation been on the political microscope of the public, which x-rays the PDP parameter of promoting justice and equity through the adoption of merit in nomination of candidates for the 2023 general elections at a time the southeast is agitating for zoning of the president to the Igbo nation in 2023.
