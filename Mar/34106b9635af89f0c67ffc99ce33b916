A professor at the University of Calabar has made history as the first jailbird among electoral officers INEC usually draws from varsities across the nation to manage elections.
An Akwa Ibom State High Court 2 sitting in the Ikot Ekpene sentenced Peter Ogban, a professor of soil physics and conservation, to three years imprisonment for electoral fraud he committed during the 2019 elections in the state on Thursday.
The contest was between APC’s Sen Godswill Akpabio and his PDP challenger Chris Ekpenyong.
Ogban was the collation/returning officer during the National Assembly elections when he manipulated and falsified election results in Oruk Anam and Etim Ekpo  in favour of the APC.
In his ruling, the trial judge, Justice Augustine Odokwo, said the court has proven beyond reasonable doubts that Ogban was guilty of the charges.
Odokwo then handed him three years imprisonment and a fine of N100,000 for the two counts respectively, after the accused had pleaded for mercy.
In his plea, Ogban said he has a 90-year-old mother to support, and he is such an essential member of his local and academic communities which will really miss him.
“If I lose my source of income, it means all of my dependents I have mentioned will suffer, especially the condition of my aged mother,” he said.
He still defended his innocence, advising his colleagues in election management to not take anything for granted to avoid embarrassment.
“I should be pardoned for the inability to do this which is why I am here today. I plead that you grant me 100 per cent mercy and allow me to go and continue with my responsibilities.”
His counsel Anthony Ekpe leaded along similar lines earlier, emphasising how the election eventually went i favor of the PDP. But his pleas and his client’s fell on deaf ears.
While counsel for INEC and prosecutor, Clement Onwenwunor, applauded the court for the ruling, Ekpe said his client will appeal.
