An average of 240 patients with glaucoma attend clinic monthly, at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH), Bauchi, according to Dr Shahir Bello, Consultant Ophthalmologist,  at the hospital.
Bello, who stated this on Wednesday, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Bauchi, noted that the disease could be prevented if presented early to health facilities, as late presentation might lead to blindness.
“On the average, we see 60 patients with glaucoma a week and about 240 in a month. If one gets blind with glaucoma, it cannot be reversed.
“After diagnosis and consultations, we have another option for treatment that is medication and lesser surgery,” he said.
Bello explained that the cost of treatment was expensive and often became an economic burden to the patient.
Also, Dr Funmi Oyediji, the Chairman, Local Organizing Committee, World Glaucoma Day, ATBUTH, said that the department would conduct free screening for the condition to 200 staff of the hospital on Thursday, March 11.
She noted that most patients with glaucoma were from the lower strata of the society, saying that as part of the 2021 celebration, the department would hold a symposium for patients with glaucoma to change the narrative on prevention.
“Part of the one-week annual celebration is the symposium and paper presentation to patients. Patients will talk to give the actual situation of the disease. People should also come in for regular eye check-up,” she said.
She explained that the free screening for 200 staff of ATBUTH was to celebrate the 2021 World Glaucoma Day.
