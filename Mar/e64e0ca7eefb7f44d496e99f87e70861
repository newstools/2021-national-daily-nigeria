The State Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Rt. Hon. Igo Aguma, on Friday resigned his membership of the party.
Rt. Hon. Igo Aguma in a statement acknowledged his receipt of the Supreme Court judgment that dismissed his appeal on a suit challenging the rejection of the High Court judgment that upheld him as APC chairman in Rivers State. The former state chairman protested that both the court and the ruling APC have failed to protect the rights of party members.
Rt. Hon. Igo Aguma in the statement declared:
I have received the Supreme Court judgement which dismissed my Appeal challenging the Court of Appeal decision which upturned the High Court judgment that declared me as Acting Chairman of APC in Rivers State.
“It is now clear that it is not within the purview of the Court to protect the rights and privileges of members of a political party, in this case, the APC. It is the APC that should protect the rights of her members but has failed to do so.
“I cannot continue to be a member of a political party that endangers and does not give any form of protection to the rights of its members and has no respect whatsoever for its own constitution at all but chooses to be run against democratic principles for self-destructive purposes.
“Therefore, I announce my exit from the All Progressives Congress immediately. To God be the glory.”
