Rep. Jimoh Aremu, representing Egbado North/Imeko Afon Federal Constituency of Ogun, has defected from the African Democratic Congress (ADC) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
The defection notice was contained in a letter addressed to the House of Representatives and read by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila at the plenary on Wednesday in Abuja.
Aremu said that the crisis in the ADC was the reason for his defection, saying all efforts to resolve the crisis had failed.
Aremu said that he had no choice than to join the APC to attract development to his constituency.
He added that the leadership style of Gov. Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, among others, were responsible for his decision to join the APC.
The House Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu (PDP-Enugu), said there was a contradiction in the letter.
He said that to his knowledge there was no crisis in the ADC and saw no reason for the defection.
Okechukwu said that the admiration expressed for Gov. Abiodun by the defector was not authentic for defection.
The Speaker asked Okechukwu to mention the name of ADC chairman to prove he knew there was no crisis in the party.
When Okechukwu did not, Gbajabiamila described the intervention of Okechukwu as “meddlesome interloper”, and turned down his plea.
