The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, and Governor of Adamawa State, Umar Fintiri, on Tuesday, intervened and reconciled Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State after hostile exchange of fireworks over the right of Fulani herdsmen to be in possession of  AK-47 rifles or otherwise.
The four Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors held a peace and reconciliation meeting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Tuesday. Governor Ortom of Benue and Governor Mohammed of Bauchi admitted that they have resolved their disagreement, noting that the issues were misinterpreted. The two governors shifted the blame of the controversies to the failure of the security architecture of the federal government led by President Muhammadu Bihari.
Governor Samuel Ortom and Governor Bala Mohammed agreed to continue to partner and work with each other for the common interest of their people. They thanked Governor Nyesom Wike and Governor Umaru Fintiri for the intervention including peace and reconciliation meeting,
At the end, they all accepted to let the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders carry their load and burden of the failures of their party government.
Governor Mohammed of Bauchi had declared that the killer Fulani herdsmen can carry AK-47 for self-defence to protect their cows from being rustled. Governor Ortom, however, challenged the Bauchi State governor for encouraging terrorism.
