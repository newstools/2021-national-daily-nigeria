The two factions of the African Alliance Congress (AAC) clashed on Monday at the INEC headquarters where the Omoyele Sowore-led group went to stage a protest that eventually failed.
The Leonard Ezenwa group chased the other faction away, claiming its leader Sowore has been expelled from the party.
Sowore and his group attempted to occupy the INEC headquarters because the commission recognized the other faction.
Speaking with reporters in Abuja on Monday Nzenwa recalled that his group had last week alerted the general public of an ongoing mobilization to hide under the name of the AAC to wreak havoc on and burn down INEC offices nationwide.
“AAC as a legal, responsible and law-abiding political party in Nigeria do not have anything to do with Omoyele Sowore as he is UNKNOWN to the Party as he and 29 others were expelled on August 9, 2019 after he was suspended,” Ezenwa said.
“We have intercepted various posters, flyers and other promotional items produced by this expelled member wherein he used our great party as plank to embark on this mission of discrediting the party.”
According to him,  the action of Sowore, Sahara Reporters publisher and convener of  Revolution Now kingpin action amounts to threat to national security, acts of criminal impersonation, disturbance of public peace, incitement of disturbances, furnishing of false information, causing of public nuisance, making of false documents and criminal intimidation.
Nzenwa said the party first suspended, later removed and went ahead to expel Omoyele Sowore over various proven allegations of financial recklessness and misappropriation of party funds, abuse of party constitution, high-handedness among others.
“Resort by Omoyele Sowore to plot to Occupy INEC, a criminal action, is not only abhorrent but an insane act of personal vendetta misdirected against the Commission,’ he said.
