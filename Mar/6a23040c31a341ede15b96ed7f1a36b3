Two youths from Afghanistan face five-year imprisonment for their role in setting a fire that destroyed the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos in 2020, local media reported on Wednesday.
The two were to be sent to a juvenile detention facility on the mainland, according to the reports.
The verdict was reportedly reached on Tuesday while their attorney announced plans to appeal.
A separate court case against four adult suspects in the case remains ongoing.
The Moria camp was destroyed in the fire in September.
There were no dead or injured.
The former residents, who have all remained on Lesbos, have lived in an even less permanent tent structure since the fire.
