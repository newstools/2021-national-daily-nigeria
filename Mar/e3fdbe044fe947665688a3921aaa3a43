AGF Abubakar Malami has distanced himself and his office from allegations he is piling pressure on APC National Leader Bola Tinubu, through the EFCC probe, in order to frustrate the former governors 2023 ambition.
Some political analysts espoused the conspiracy theory when news broke last week the EFCC, under its new leader Abdulrasheed Bawa, commenced probe of Tinubu last year when the commission’s former boss, Ibrahim Magu was suspended.
Magu was believed to be Tinubu’s man, and according to the analysts, Malami is also eyeing the 2023 presidency.
In an interview on Channels Television on Tuesday, the AGF said he was noti any way investigation the party leader.
Malami, however, said he could not say if the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission or the Code of Conduct Bureau were investigating Tinubu.
“Within the context of the law as you rightly know, the EFCC and the Code of Conduct are all statutory bodies vested with statutory powers to act within the context of the law establishing them. So, I am not in a position to give you a precise answer,” he said.
