Concerned Youths in Enugu State on Tuesday protest against the proposed life pension bill for ex-governors and their deputies in the state House of Assembly.
The youth led by their leader, Mr Wilfred Okeke expressed dismay at the development demanding that the bill should be withdrawn.
“This bill is not in the interest of the public, it is even coming at a time that the people are passing through excruciating economic reality.
“It is unfair for former governors and their deputies to earn pensions, how can they ask for such earnings when retired civil servants have yet to be paid gratuity and pension after several years,” he said.
Responding, the Assembly Speaker, Mr Edward Ubosi, restated the assembly’s commitment to make laws that would drive sustainable development in the state.
The speaker said that the legislature under his watch would not enact laws that would negatively impact on the development of the state.
“We are aware of the controversy and mixed reactions being generated by the proposed pension bill.
“We shall look critically at the issues being raised by members of the public, as we speak, the bill has not been passed,” he said.
He said that the assembly would continue to work in the interest of the people of the state, saying, “this is the reason we were elected”
“We are not a rubber stamp legislature, we shall ensure that the right thing is done at all times,” he said.
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the bill sponsored by the Majority Leader, Ikechukwu Ezeugwu, scaled first reading on March 9 at the assembly.
NAN reports that the bill proposed life pension and gratuity for the former governors as well as N12 million medical allowance for their wives for life.
Also included in the entitlements for the ex governors are provision of three new vehicles each every four years and a state burial and one year salary for the family after death.
