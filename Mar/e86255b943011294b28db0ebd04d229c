Two Poland players have tested positive for the coronavirus ahead of Wednesday’s World Cup qualifier against England, Polish football association spokesman, Jakub Kwiatkowski, has said.
Locomotive Moscow midielder Grzegorz Krychowiak and Rakow Czestochowa defender Kamil Piatkowski tested positive, Kwiatkowski tweeted on Tuesday.
However, since Krychowiak had already contracted the Sars-CoV-2 virus before, talks were ongoing with European football federation UEFA on allowing him to play in the Wembley game.
Poland is also without their biggest star, Robert Lewandowski, who injured a knee ligament during Sunday’s match against Andorra.
England leads the qualifying group with six points in two games, ahead of Poland and Hungary who have four each.
