The Police on Tuesday arraigned two unemployed men, Seyi Johnson, 28 and Yusuf Sultan, 20, before an Ikeja Chief Magistrate’s Court for alleged conspiracy and breach of peace.
The defendants, whose addresses were not given, are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and breach of peace.
The duo, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.
According to the Police Prosecutor, ASP. Benson Emuerhi, the defendants conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace by attacking innocent passersby.
Emuerhi told the court that the defendants committed the offences with others still at large on Feb. 24 about 10.30 p.m. at Owode Ibeshe Bus Stop, Ikorodu, Lagos.
“The defendants conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause the breach of peace by attacking innocent passersby at Ibeshe Bus Stop,” the prosecutor submitted.
The Chief Magistrate, Mrs J.A. Adegun, admitted the defendants to N50,000 bail with one surety in like sum.
Adegun ordered that the surety must be gainfully employed and have evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State government.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the alleged offences violate Sections 168 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015.
NAN also reports that breach of peace is punishable with six months’ jail term or a fine of N50,000, while conspiracy attracts two years’ jail term.
The Magistrate adjourned the case until April 26 for mention.
