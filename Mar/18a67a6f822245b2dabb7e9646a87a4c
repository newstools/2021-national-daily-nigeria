Controversies have continued to trail the death of Ernest Azuzu, a popular Nollywood actor who died mysteriously on January, 2021 at a Hotel in Ijegun area of Lagos state.
It would be recalled that the deceased was reported to have allegedly died during a sex romp with a commercial sex worker, identified as Emmanuella Daniel, in a hotel named “New Spot One” in Ijegun area of Lagos State, Nigeria.
Manager of the hotel known as Daniel Okorie, who is also a Musician, with the help of one Prophet Chimezie, moved the deceased to Igando General hospital, where he was said to have been confirmed as ‘BID’, meaning Brought In Dead.
The hotel was sealed due to the development by operatives of the Lagos State Police Command on the directives of the Commissioner of Police, to allow for a thorough investigation into the unfolding issue.
It was later revealed that the management of the hotel, in defiance to the directive by the Lagos CP, had gone ahead to break the police seal on the apartment and commenced operations immediately, a development which spurred a team of investigative journalists to proceed to the hotel on a fact-finding mission.
Only recently, some journalists who were investigating the matter were allegedly attacked and detained by hoodlums in the hotel premises for daring to ask questions
The attack on the journalists, sources disclosed, may not be unconnected to a desperate move by the hotel owner to cover up some illegal activities happening within the building as information gathered reveals that the “New Spot One” hotel has been known to harbor various illicit trades including drug dealings, prostitution and the likes.
A staff of the hotel, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that the hotel management broke the police seal to the premise and has resumed operation since February 11, 2021 prior to the visit by the four journalists on February 24, 2021.
Until his death, Azuzu had starred in at least 150 Nollywood films including Burning Desire, Broad Daylight, Ogidan, and Living Abroad amongst others.
