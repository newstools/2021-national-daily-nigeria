The military now in control of Myanmar has released more than 600 anti-coup protesters, according to state television and local media outlets on Wednesday.
The protesters were mostly students who had been detained at police stations and in prisons after protesting against the coup, Eleven Myanmar and Myanmar Now reported.
Demonstrators staged a so-called “silent strike’’ on Wednesday, with protesters staying at home and many businesses closing around the country.
Streets were empty in many cities, and few vehicles were seen in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city,
“This is another way to fight the military. I can be silent to show how we are rejecting them,’’ a protester from Tamwe township in Yangon said.
The military has resorted to violence to quash demonstrations against the February 1 coup and the ousting of the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi.
According to the non-profit prisoner’s assistance organisation AAPP, at least 275 people have been killed and 2,812 people have been detained.
The UN sharply condemned the violence and also said it was “deeply concerned about the continued use of force against children’’.
According to UNICEF, at least 23 children have been killed in the violence since the coup.
