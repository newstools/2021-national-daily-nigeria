Former presidential adviser Doyin Okupe misyarned, apologized, during he week, but his apology was a waste as his comment on Igbo 2023 still drew the fire of Ohaneze.
The pan-Igbo group describes Okupe as unstable—ad in need of urgent medical attention.
The twitter-happy former adviser, in a series of tweets on Saturday, claimed that the North are yet to forgive the Igbo for killing Sardauna of Sokoto in the 1966 coup.
For that reason, he said, there can be no national consensus for an Igbo presidency.
“If this consensus emerges, in the interest of equity, fairness & national unity, I will shelve my ambition & support whoever is chosen as a candidate by my party,” he said.
“However, in the event that this national consensus is not achievabe, I WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2023 by God’s Grace.
But President-General of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, in a statement said there is every indication that Doyin Okupe needs urgent medical attention.
“His action is not far from a person that is mentally deranged, he said.
“He is being tormented by Aso Rock spirit and needs both orthodox treatment and spiritual deliverance.”
Okwu said some politicians are using Okupe to derail the train on the quest of Igbo presidency in 2023.
“They saw in him an unsound mind and capitalized on it to insult the sensibilities of Ndigbo. We advise his family to help him before his condition deteriorates. He is having issues with his mental capacity.”
The group insisted Igbo presidency is non-negotiable.
“A million mad people like Doyin Okupe will not stop Ndigbo. He should go and face his case before the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.”
