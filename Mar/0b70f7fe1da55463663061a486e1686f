The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Bayelsa, says it has sealed four petrol stations in Yenagoa for under dispensing and selling above government approved price per litre.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports on Thursday that the exercise took place when officials of the department paid an unscheduled visit to some retail petrol outlets.
The exercise was led by the Operational Controller of DPR in the state field office, Mr Ogbe Nicholas.
The affected filling stations included B.M. links Ltd, Tamic Nig. Ltd, Ereboter Oil and Maccary Petroleum Ltd, while NNPC mega station, Total Quartz, Tonimas Oil, Gamag Oil and NNPC outlets were selling at government approved price.
“We also want to be sure that the products are dispensed at the right quantity. The petrol stations sealed committed various infractions.
“For those under dispensing, there were penalties for them, when we seal they will go an pay the necessary fine for sealing and they will show evidence of payment from DPR special account.
“The agency responsible for price regulation is Petroleum Pricing Regulatory Agency, which is our sister agency,” he explained.
He said that the price for PMS is N162 to N165 per litre, and not otherwise, as some marketers will want to cheat the public.
The controller said in any business there are rules and regulations guiding them, especially in the oil industry, down stream, to be specific.
Nicholas said that DPR frowns at those petrol stations that are unlicensed, saying if your station is not licensed, you are doing an illegal business, and if we find out appropriate punishment will be slammed on the offender.
He stated that all the fueling stations visited are licenced. These licences will be renewed accordingly when they expire.
