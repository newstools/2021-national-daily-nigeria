APC’s national leader Bola Tinubu has shocked not a few of his kinsmen agitating for a Yoruba nation when he declared March 29 that Yoruba and Fulani have same blood flowing in their veins.
He stated his during his 12th The Tinubu Colloquium hosted in Kano and chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari.
“Why are we in Kano? It is to demonstrate to Nigerians at this critical time. It is because there is a Fulani man, a herder (man) who gave his daughter to a farmer, (a) Yoruba man… and some people are agitating wrongly.”
The late Oyo Gov Isiaka Ajimobi’s son married Kao Gov Umar Ganduje’s daughter in 2018. Tinubu was the bride price bearer for Buhari who acted the bride’s father.
Tinubu said he chose Kano for the occasion to let secessionists in Yorubaland agitating for a break-up  know Nigeria is better united.
“I was encouraged to go and spend a couple of days with my brother and in-law in Kano and demonstrate that he has not quarrelled with me, he has not seceded from Nigeria, “he said.
“I didn’t need a passport or visa to get to Kano. Maybe others will have peace of conscience, live in peace and harmony and be loving to one another. That is what Ganduje and I are showing to Nigerians and that is the purpose of this colloquium. End of story.”
Tinubu is believed to be eyeing the 2023 presidency, and many believe his nationalist zeal is part of the groundwork.
