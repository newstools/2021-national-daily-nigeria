The governor  promised to continue collaboration with the  FRSC for enabling environment to carry out their duties.
“We have constructed old and new roads to avert accidents. With the records on ground, no government has been able to achieve the kilometres of roads this government achieved in the first term.
“More roads will still be constructed with road furniture being put in place as requested,” he said
Abe, on his part, said that 49 people had died from road accidents from January till date, while  no fewer than 200 were injured.
