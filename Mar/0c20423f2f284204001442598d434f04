A 29-year-old man, Christopher David, who has been standing trial for alleged stealing, was on Wednesday re-arraigned before a Surulere Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, for allegedly sending life-threatening text messages to the complainant.
The defendant, who has no fixed address, was re-arraigned on a two-count charge of stealing and threat to life.
Christopher, who was first arraigned on a count charge of stealing on Nov. 24, 2020, was re-arrested for allegedly threatening the life of the complainant after he was granted bail.
The prosecutor, Insp. Courage Ekhueorohan, told the court that Christopher committed the alleged threat to life  on March 6, on Bode Thomas Street, Surulere.
Ekhueorohan alleged that Christopher was first apprehended for stealing women’s clothing materials worth N106,000 from the complainant,  Mr Akanimo Iyanam.
The prosecutor submitted that the complainant had employed
Christopher for a day job of cleaning at his residence, where he was caught with the materials and arrested.
He said that after Christopher secured bail, he started sending life-threatening messages to the complainant, who invited the police to re-arrest him.
Christopher, however, pleaded not the charge.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the alleged  offences are punishable under Sections 168 and 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The Magistrate, Mrs M.I. Dan-Oni, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N50,000, with one surety in like sum.
She  adjourned the case until April 30 for mention.
