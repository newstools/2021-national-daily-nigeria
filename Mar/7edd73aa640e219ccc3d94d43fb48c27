While scores of students remain in captivity of kidnappers in Kaduna, no fewer than 300 more could have joined them, perhaps elsewhere, but for intervention of security forces Saturday night.
As a result 307 students were later protected from kidnappers who  attacked Government Science Secondary School, Ikara in Kara Local Government Area in Kaduna in the early hours of Sunday.
According to Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, the students were rescued unhurt by troops who foiled the attempted kidnap.
“Between the late hours of Saturday night and the early hours of today, suspected bandits stormed the school in an attempt to kidnap students,” he said.
“Fortunately, the students utilized the security warning system in place and were thus able to alert security forces in the area.
He said the security forces comprised the troops of the Nigerian Army, Police and some security volunteers moved swiftly to the school and engaged the bandits, forcing them to flee.
Kidnapping school children has become rampant in the northwest lately, starting from Katsina in last December to Zamfara in February.
