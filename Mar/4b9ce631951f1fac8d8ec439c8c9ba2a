Former Chief Justice of Nigeria Walter Onnoghen, has revealed why and how he was booted out of office while preparation for the 2019 election was on.
He said he was aware of the conspiracy to sack him because of his perceived dalliance with the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar.
Onnoghen said he decided not respond then.
“Prior to my suspension, there were rumours that I met with Atiku in Dubai. As I am talking here today, I have never met Atiku one on one in my life, hr said in Abuja at a book launch on Thursday.
Onnoghen said he was surprised that though the Federal Government had all the machinery to investigate the allegation, it never did, but opted to unlawfully come after him and his office.
He warned that Nigeria needs courageous judges now.
“During my tenure, the problem of Nigeria was not the Nigerian judiciary, but those who had no regard for the rule of law,” he said.
“We must therefore be committed to the rule of law and dispense justice without fear or favour.”
President Muhammadu Buhari rivaled and defeated the PDP candidate Atiku i the 2019 presidential elction.
