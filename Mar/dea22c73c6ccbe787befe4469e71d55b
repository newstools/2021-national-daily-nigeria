The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) at the weekend enjoined President Muhammadu Buhari not to allow Boko Haram terrorists executive Pastor Bulus Yakuru who is in their captivity. The association demanded the president to order the military to intervene and commence rescue operation before the terrorists slaughter the pastor.
CAN President, Reverend Samson Ayokunle, had in a statement on Saturday, cautioned that President Buhari should not allow Pastor Yakuru to be slaughtered by the Noko Haram terrorists as they slaughtered Reverend Lawan Andimi.
It was recalled that Rev Andimi, District Chairman of the EYN and CAN Chairman of Michika Local Government in Adamawa State, was kidnapped by the Boko Haram terrorists who subsequently slaughtered him in January 2020.
The CAN President declared that the rescue of Yakuru has become a litmus test for the new service chiefs of the Nigerian military.
“Why should the government leave the citizens of this country at the mercy of insurgents, bandits and kidnappers? What then is the essence of having a government in place?
“The world is watching whether the new Service Chiefs will live up to expectations. If the then United States President, Donald Trump, ordered his military to rescue one kidnapped American in Nigeria, our President must act decisively on Pastor Yakuru,” the CAN Prescient declared.
Boko Haram terrorists kidnapped Pastor Yakuru of the Church of the Brethren (EYN) when they attacked Pemi Village, Borno State, on 24 December 2020. They killed at least six persons in that operation.
Pastor Yakuru was said to be held captive by the Abubakar Shekau faction of Boko Haram. The terrorists had in a video last Wednesday issued one week ultimatum to the Nigerian government to respond to their demands or the pastor will be killed.
