One of the granddaughters of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II has given birth to a son.
Zara Tindall, the daughter of Princess Anne, gave birth on Sunday at the home she shares with her husband, Mike, a spokesman for the couple confirmed on Wednesday.
The couples, who already have two daughters, have named their new born Lucas Philip Tindall.
Mike, who is an English rugby player said, “a little baby boy arrived at my house.
“Arrived very quickly. Didn’t make it to hospital. She gave birth on the bathroom floor,’’ he said on his rugby-themed podcast.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said, “the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are delighted with the news and look forward to meeting their 10th great-grandchild when circumstances allow.’’
Zara is a professional horse rider and previously won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics in the equestrian category.
