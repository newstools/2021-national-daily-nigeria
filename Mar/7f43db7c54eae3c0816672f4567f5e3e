This month of March promises to be memorable as phase 2 of ‘Your LoveWorld Specials’ (season 3) with the man of God, Reverend (Dr.) Chris takes the airwaves. Slated to commence from today Monday, March 1 to Friday, March 5, 2021, the impactful 5-day telecast will be relayed to a teeming global audience via all LoveWorld Networks and various internet platforms.
During phase 1 of the current season 3, the President of Loveworld Incorporated, Pastor Chris, expounded unequivocally on the pulsating armoury of a Christian; steering the global audience to employ faith proclamations, intercessory prayers and prophecies to chart their course of perpetual victory in life. He enjoined the saints to maintain a daily consciousness of eternal life to ultimately live the God-life in the present.
The global audience that exceeded a cumulative 3.5billion unique viewership was daily catapulted from faith to faith as the inspiring sessions of the iconic telecast brought to light the undiluted Word of God in its simplicity. Diverse healings unfurled, dozens gave their hearts to Christ and many more were impassioned about their Christianity.
The beckoning phase of this epochal series heralds similar and greater prospects. Exhilarating melodies of the Spirit will be made to the Lord, earnest prayers offered, and God’s Word will be rightly divided resulting in outstanding testimonies of healings and salvation.
Don’t be left out. Tune in to any LoveWorld TV station or log on to www.pastorchrisonline.org at 7pm GMT+1 daily beginning Monday, March 1, 2021 to participate live.
