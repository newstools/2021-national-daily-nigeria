The Secretary of Ekiti United Football Club of Ado-Ekiti, Ayodeji Olowolafe, on Wednesday said the process of getting a befitting vehicle for the club is underway.
Olowolafe disclosed this while expressing appreciation to the Ekiti State Government for coming to their aid after the team’s players and officials were involved in an accident recently.
”We thank Gov. Kayode Fayemi for providing a vehicle for our week eight match in the Nigeria National League (NNL) in Enugu,” he said in a statement.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ekiti United’s official vehicle had an accident along the Ikere-Ekiti/Ado-Ekiti Road.
The accident had happened when the team was returning from a training ground at Ikere-Ekiti.
“The state government provided for us a Coaster bus, through the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, to convey the team to Enugu.
“This made the long trip to be quite interesting and comfortable for the players and officials.
”But the process is already on for us to get another vehicle,” Olowolafe said in the statement.
The team’s captain, Babatunde Bello, also said the bus provided by the state government made the trip to Enugu one of their best in recent times.
He assured football enthusiasts in Ekiti that the players would give their 100 per cent to ensure they picked one point from their midweek encounter.
NAN reports that Ekiti United are up against Giant Brillars on Wednesday.
