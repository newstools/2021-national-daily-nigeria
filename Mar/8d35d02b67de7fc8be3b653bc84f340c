The chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal Umar Danladi Umar has conducted himself in a manner that showed he doesn’t care about displaying his martial art in public, and inflicting bodily harm on people.
The chairman, a judge of sorts, in his crispy suit unleashed  a blitz of running kicks and slaps which brought down a security guard  at Banex Plaza, Wuse, in Abuja March 29.
The video of the hand-to-hand is already trending, showing the yellow-complexioned judge being restrained by his police orderlies from unleashing more force on the security guard who only asked him to park his car well on the premises.
“The CCT chairman was on the verge of further hitting the young security guard with a dangerous object taken from his car, when passersby and shop owners stopped him from further attacking the young security guard,” an eyewitness said.
The abuse of office provoked Nigerians on the premises. So they locked the facility’s main gate and started hurling objects at his car, breaking the screen.
Umar, however, went away with the guard, dropping him off at the Maitama Police Station for prosecution.
But an Abuja-based legal practitioner, Ihensekhien Samuel Jnr, went to the station to represent the guard.
On watching the viciousness chairman Umar, the Divisional Police Officer at Maitama ordered release of the young security guard on bail.
Samuel said steps would be taken to promptly sue and prosecute Umar.
“This is a breach of extant provisions of judicial code of any arbiter, and the height of impunity of any kind,” he said.
Umar became the tribunal chairman about the age of 40, in a controversial circumstance, with allegations of corruption the EFCC levelled against him.
Nigeria’s judiciary also took him down a peg or two by warning him not to count himself as a justice.
