Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Solomon Enang has revealed the desperate move of Senator Goodswill Akpabio, the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs to have him sacked by all means over a minor disagreement.
Ita Enang who disclosed this recently at a media parley called on the Elders of Niger Delta to help him as his job is on the verge of vanishing due to heavy bribery pressure by Senator Akpabio.
According to Senator Enang, he is being threatened with a sack following a mild disagreement he had with Senator Godswill Akpabio over who should take credit for the newly commissioned headquarters of Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.
Angered by Ita Enangâ€™s comments, Senator Akpabio is alleged to have lodged a whopping sum of 2 billion naira to a very powerful figure within the Presidency. The money according to a reliable source is to perfect the sack of Senator Ita Enang.
Ita Enang who is nursing the governorship ambition in Akwa Ibom said that he was given a lifeline to withdraw the statement and disclaim the same, an offer that he has personally undertaken.
Senator Ita Enang further called on the stakeholders in the Akwa Ibom State and Niger Delta to come to his rescue as Akpabio is doing everything to hatch him out from the villa.
