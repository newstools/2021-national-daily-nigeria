Protesters honked car horns in Myanmar on Monday and planted posters in an empty square to avoid arrest, injury or death as the EU prepare to impose sanctions on 11 people linked to last coup.
At least 250 people have been killed so far in anti-junta protests which the security forces were trying to stamp out, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.
“The number of murders has reached an unbearable extent, which was why we will not be able to avoid imposing sanctions,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters as he arrived in Brussels for a meeting with his EU counterparts.
The names of 11 people involved in the coup and repression of demonstrators would be made public after the meeting, the EU’s foreign policy Chief Josep Borrell said.
They would be the bloc’s most significant response to the coup so far.
According to diplomats and two internal documents seen by Reuters last week, the EU is also planning to target companies “generating revenue for, or providing financial support to, the Myanmar Armed Forces”.
“We don’t intend to punish the people of Myanmar but those who blatantly violate human rights,” Maas said.
A spokesman for the junta did not respond to calls seeking comment. He has previously said security forces have used force only when necessary.
