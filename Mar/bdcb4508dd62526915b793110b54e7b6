The leadership of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) expressed feeling of betrayal over the statement by a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, that the old man OPC members arrested in Abete, Oyo State is not the dreaded Fulani warlord, Skirli Wakili. Fani-Kayode had discredited the OPC on the celebration of the arrest of Wakili upon which the Nigeria Police detained three OPC members in Oyo State when they surrendered the Fulani warlord to the Oyo State Police Command.
Wakili was captured last week at Apete, Oyo State, after weeks that he challenged Sunday Igboho to a gun battle with his members. The Fulani warlord was arrested by the OPC members without exchange of bullets of bloodshed. The arrested Wakili as appeared in his picture on green cloth, was noticed to be in deep sleep, an indication that he may not know where he was at the time of the arrest.
However, the OPC leader, the Aare Kankanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams, gad cautioned Fani-Kayode from any act of mischief in the collective goal to end insecurity in the southwest and send away killer herdsmen from the zone. Iba Gani Adams warned Sunday Igboho to beware of Femi Fani-Kayode, cautioning Igboho not to be misled by Femi’s hidden agenda in pretense of supporting him.
Gani Adams had last weekend raised alarm that the boys of the arrested Wakili are killing people in Oyo State. He alleged that they were responsible for the slaughter of four Yoruba farmers at Igangan, Oyo State.
Meanwhile, very little is heard of Amotekun. However, all traditional security apparatuses in the southwest are joining forces to fight the intruders into Yoruba land casing harm to the people and their property.
