According to the report, five simple measures are advised as being the most effective method of dengue control.
These measures consist of closing and sealing all unused containers, flushing out all water vessels, placing small guppy fish in water jars as these eat mosquito larvae, cleaning areas around homes and doing these four tasks each week.
People, who are ill, have also been advised to take a blood test in the hospital, said the report.
