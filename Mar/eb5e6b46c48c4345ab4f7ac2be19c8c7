Mongolia’s National Agency for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring on Thursday issued a warning of strong winds and dust storms.
In the coming three days, strong winds and heavy dust storms are expected to sweep the western, central and Gobi parts of Mongolia.
In addition, heavy dust and snow storms were expected to hit eastern provinces of the country, with wind speed expected to reach 18 to 28 meters per second in large parts of the country.
The agency urged the citizens, especially nomadic herders to take extra precautions against possible disasters in the coming few days.
The warning came after 10 people, mostly herders, lost their lives due to heavy dust and snow storms that swept through large parts of Mongolia in mid-March.
