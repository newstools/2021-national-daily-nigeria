The number of U.S. air passengers screened topped 1.5 million for the first time since March 2020, as air travel continues to rebound from a pandemic-related drop, U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said on Monday.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) devastated air travel demand, with U.S. airline passengers down 60 per cent in 2020.
However, with a growing number of Americans getting vaccinated, demand and advanced bookings have started to rise in recent weeks.
The TSA said it screened 1.54 million people on Sunday, the highest single day since March 13, 2020 and the 11th consecutive day screening volume exceeding one million per day.
