Tunisian Foreign Minister Othman Jerandi has inspected the Tunisian diplomatic academy, a China-aided project under construction.
During the Monday visit, the Tunisian foreign minister, who was accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to the country, Zhang Jianguo, expressed his admiration for the quality of the work at the academy.
He praised the efforts made through such projects, by China in contributing to the development of Tunisia.
Zhang Jianguo said the programme was not only an important symbol of the friendly cooperation between China and Tunisia, but also a model project for the joint development of human resources between the two countries.
The academy, built with financial aid from the Chinese government, covers an area of about 12,000 square meters and is intended to teach and train Tunisian and foreign diplomats.
The construction of the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.
