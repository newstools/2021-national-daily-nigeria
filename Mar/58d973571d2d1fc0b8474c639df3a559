Justice Esther Edigin, Chief Judge of Edo, has extolled the leadership strides of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Director General, World Trade Organization (WTO), on the occasion of the 2021 International Women’s Day (IWD).
Edigin gave the commendation during the 9th edition of the Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO) Outstanding Women Leadership Award held in Benin on Monday.
She said Okonjo-Iweala’s appointment as the first woman to head WTO had brought smiles to faces in Africa and indeed the entire black race.
“Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, is a woman in whom we are well pleased. I dare to say, it’s just the beginning of great things to come.
“It also epitomises the vast chest of potential and value women bring to the table if and when given a chance to express ourselves and to excel.’’
National Daily reports that LAPO has overtime worked for the recognition of women’s contributions to societal development.
The LAPO Outstanding Women Leadership Award further demonstrates the organisation’s commitment to women empowerment.
It recognises and honours women who have distinguished themselves in their various endeavours: Business, Professional and Public Life.
LAPO believes that recognitions for exceptional service and contributions to the development of society should be a vital part of any dynamic, vibrant and growing society.
Three awardees for this year’s honour are Mrs Joke Adesina, in farming category, Madam Christiana Ebitimi in the business category and Madam Felicia Babalola in the professional category.
