Former Speaker Dimeji Bankole is meeting the APC Caretaker Committee Chairman and Gov. Mai Mala Buni  in the lead-up to Ogun politician defection to the ruling APC.
Bankole has nearly slipped into political oblivion since he left his former party PDP years ago—before he moved to the Action Democratic Party (ADP).
According to Buni’s director general of press and media affairs, Mamman Mohammed, the two discussed a wide range of political issues, including the movement of the former Speaker and his supporters into the party.
“It is evident that APC’s opportunities in Ogun state is growing and widening. Recently, a former governor of Ogun state, Otumba Gbenga Daniel who was Director General of PDP’s Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign Organization joined the party,” Mohammed said.
The APC caretaker committee barnstormed most of the states in the federation reconciling fractious state chapters, and baiting back former members, and even jaded politicians of yesteryears irrespective of their parties.
Bunis effort has yielded fruit.
Ebonyi Gov. David Umahi dumped his ruling PDP for the APC recently. More PDP governors are expected to cross over too.
