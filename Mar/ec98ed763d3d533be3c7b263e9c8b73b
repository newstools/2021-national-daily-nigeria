Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have attacked the Federal College of Forestry, a few metres away from the Nigerian Defence Academy in the Mando area of Kaduna state, abducting several students.
Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige who confirmed the incident to newsmen on Friday, said the exact number of students abducted is currently unknown.
According to him, the gunmen invaded the college at about 3 am on Friday and abducted some students. He explained that security operatives were mobilized to the college upon hearing about the attack and were able to secure the remaining students.
The spokesman also said that an investigation is ongoing to ascertain the actual numbers of students that were abducted with a view to track down the gunmen and rescue the victims.
The fresh abduction comes 48 hours after the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, presented the 2020 security situation reports to Governor Nasir El-Rufai.
Aruwan said bandits killed no fewer than 937 persons, kidnapped 1,972 persons in the state in 2020.
On his part, Governor El-Rufai had ruled out the possibility of his administration to negotiate or grant amnesty to bandits.
Recall that gunmen had earlier abducted students and staff of Government Science Secondary School, Kagara, Niger State, and Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, Zamfara State.
