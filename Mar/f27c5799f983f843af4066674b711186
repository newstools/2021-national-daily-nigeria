The Executive Secretary of the Board, Alhaji Muhammed Abba, made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Kano.
According to him,  the board is still attending to more intending pilgrims who are coming  for registration.
“We have opened 16 induction courses across the 44 Local Government Areas in the state for Saturday and Sunday till Ramadan period.
“After Ramadan, additional 32 course centres will be opened within the state with daily inductors.
