A retired civil servant, Manason Rubainu, was on Monday arraigned before a Chief Magistrates’ Court in Gwagwalada, FCT, for alleged criminal trespass and forgery.
Rubainu, who lives at plot 262 of Gwagwalada expansion layout, was docked on a three-count charge bordering on criminal trespass, forgery and using forged documents as genuine.
The prosecuting counsel, Dabo Yakubu, told the court that the defendant trespassed into the land of the complainant, Mohammed Okpanachi, sometime in January, 2016.
Yakubu said the land was situated at plot 139 Gwagwalada, expansion layout and measuring 2,300 square meters.
He said the defendant erected a dwarf fence on the land, and during police investigation presented papers which a report by the Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS) showed not to be genuine.
Yakubu said from the report the land in dispute belonged to the complainant.
He said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 348, 364 and 366 of the Penal Code.
The defendant pleaded not guilty to the offences.
The defence counsel, Owobu Godday, in his bail application prayed the court to admit his client to bail in the most liberal terms.
He cited sections 158 and 162 of the Administrative of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) to buttress his point for the bail of his client.
Godday said an accused person was presumed innocent until proven guilty by the law, adding that if granted, he would not jump bail.
Chief Magistrate, Aliyu Shafa, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N500, 000 with one reasonable surety in like sum who must reside within the court jurisdiction.
He adjourned the case until April 15 for hearing. (NAN)
