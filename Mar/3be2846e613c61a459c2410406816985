The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) on Wednesday issued a seven-day strike notice to the Ekiti State House of Assembly, protesting irregular disengagement of some staff.
The NLC communicating the strike notice on Wednesday, to the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Funminiyi Afuye, threatened to mobilise all workers in the state for the strike action.
The NLC demanded the Speaker to order immediate reinstatement of 21 workers of the House of Assembly, that were disengaged by the House of Assembly Service Commission (HASC), early in the year.
The congress insisted that workers in the state would commence an indefinite strike on Wednesday, March 10, if the Assembly fails to recall the affected workers.
The appointment of the affected workers was in January terminated for perceived illegal recruitment process into the service by the past administration.
Copies of the strike notice dated Mach 3, 2021, signed by the Secretaries of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Akinyemi Eunice; Secretary, Trade Union Congress, Kuloogun Lawrence, and a member of the Joint Negotiating Council, Gbenga Olowoyo, were made public on Wednesday.
The organized labour protested that the state leadership of the unions had waited patiently enough for the leadership of the Ekiti State House Assembly to address this issue of 21 sacked workers by recalling them, but to no avail.
“Consequently, the entire Civil Servants of Ekiti State, through the organised labour leadership, are hereby demanding for the immediate reinstatement of the 21 sacked workers of the House of Assembly within seven days from Thursday, March 4, 2021,” they declared.
