Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Thursday celebrated his legal victory over the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, commending the Court of Appeal for the judgement on the certificate forgery suit filed by the APC against him. The Edo State governor expressed delight as Appeal Court on Thursday exonerated him from the certificate forgery suit, and dismissed the APC suit which questioned his eligibility for the November 2020 governorship election in Edo State, and awarded a cost of N250,000 against the APC.
Governor Obaseki in a statement in Benin City indicated that the judgement of the Court of Appeal vindicated him; he remarked that the suit from the outset, was a facetious attempt to swindle Edo people through the backdoor as it was without any merit whatsoever.
Obaseki declared: “The judgement today by the Appeal Court sitting in Abuja is a victory for democracy, equity, fairness and justice. It further reassures confidence in the judiciary as an impartial umpire.
“From the content of the judgement, ab initio, all Edo people knew there was no merit in the case. It was ill-willed. It is comforting that the judiciary has upheld the truth and the verdict of Edo people.”
The Court of Appeal, Abuja, in the judgment on Thursday, held that the lower court did not made any mistake, noting that the plaintiff and witnesses did not prove the governor forged the certificate.
The Appeal court held that the judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja, was apt and very clear, noting that the Registrar of the University of Ibadan presented convincing witness that Obaseki was admitted into the university to study Classics and was awarded degree certificate. The court, therefore, dismissed the suit, noting that the appellant failed to prove his case.
