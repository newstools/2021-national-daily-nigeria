While the PDP is making Nigerians believe it is not zoning its presidential ticket in 2023, words and body language of its members increasingly reveal the party’s ticket is no free-for-all thing.
A federal lawmaker just aired out the plan B of the party, and the soused candidate is from the second region claiming moral entitlement to the presidency.
Hon. Tajudeen Yusuf (PDP-Kogi) recently opened up on Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, as the right candidate for the 2023 presidency.
The speculation has largely been about the north producing the candidate, and the focus of a powerful caucus within the party has been Sokoto Gov Aminu Tambuwal who ran for the primary in 2023. Wike was initially speculated his ideal running mate, especially considering the closeness of the two governors.
The older element, though, seem bent on fielding their perennial candidate and former V.P Atiku Abubakar.
But as the south-south rears up again in the calculation, Wike is now being projected.
The projection is not unconnected to the realization that former President Goodluck Jonathan is not interested in coming back to Aso Rock. Jonathan briefly became the darling of the PDP and the APC early in the year.
The former president, however, cleared all the rumours days ago—as unfounded, and that he is not interested.
So the PDP speculators and armchair kingmakers like Yusuf picked the nearest guy in the south-south.
The rep, on Monday, noted that Wike would be a good candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) because Wike has positively impacted all sectors of the state’s economy; revolutionising the health, agricultural and education sectors.
“Wike is the man who will return PDP to power at the centre again”, he added.
