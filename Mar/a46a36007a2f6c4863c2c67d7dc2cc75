Former JAMB Regustrar and CEO Dibu Ojeride has been detained in Abuja by the ICPC following a claim he misappropriated N900 million while he headed the exam board between 2007 and 2016.
Ojerinde was arrested on Monday in Abuja, by ICPC operatives.
Other allegations against him include tax evasion, abuse of office, money-laundering and false information.
According to a statement on Wednesday by the ICPC spokesperson, Azuka Ogugua, Ojerinde allegedly awarded contracts for the supply of pencils and erasers at the cost of N450 million each to Double 07 Concept Ltd. and Pristine Global Concept Ltd., respectively, between 2013 and 2014 while heading JAMB.
“There is no evidence to show that the items which are examination materials were supplied as the contractors cannot be found,” JAMB said.
‘’Similar contracts were allegedly awarded to Solid Figures Limited, Holywalk Limited and other companies for various sums without any trace of executions.
‘’Professor Ojerinde is being held on a remand warrant and will soon be charged to court upon the conclusion of investigation.’’
Last year, through a court order, Ojerinde’s properties were taken over by the federal government, based on the belief the properties were proceeds of unlawful corrupt activities.
