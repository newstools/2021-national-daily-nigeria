Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Monday declared that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has the confidence, capacity, and commitment to save Nigeria from the current socio-economic crises. He noted that Nigerians have already seen and known the capacity of the PDP to promote the development of the country. The Rivers governor challenged the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to tell Nigerians what the party has achieved. He scolded the Buhari administration for repetitively saying the FG want to flag off Maiduguri rail line.
Governor Wike at the commissioning of Rumuji-Ibaa-Obele-Isiokpo Road in Emohua Local Government Area, Rivers State, declared: “This is a party that Nigerians have seen, Rivers State has seen that we have the confidence, we have the commitment to save Nigeria.
“Let them tell us what they have done for Rivers State. I hear they want to flag off railway gauge to Maiduguri. Is that what we need? That is not our project. You want to build Bonny Deep Sea, for how many years?”
Governor Wike enjoined the people of Rivers State to resists ploys by politicians to be deceive them. He said that many political leaders make promises merely to woo the masses into joining their parties.
Wike, therefore, advocated that politicians must be held accountable for their actions and promises made during electioneering campaign.
Governor Wike stated: “It is not just to make promises in order to attract people.  Make promises and fulfill it. The time has come that we must hold politicians responsible.
“We must hold them accountable for whatever they tell us. It is not when they tell you story finish, after voting they abandon you.”
