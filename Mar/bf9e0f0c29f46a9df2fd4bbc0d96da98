Tanzanians on Saturday came out enmass, lining the streets of Dar es Salaam bidding farewell to late President John Magufuli,, wailing and spreading flower petals as the casket was conveyed in a motorcade from a Church to Uhuru Stadium where the late president was laid in state.
President Samia Suluhu Hassan led thousands of mourners to honour the demised President John Magufuli, who died within the week after an illness that was kept in top secret.
Hassan, the vice president, sworn in on Friday to become Tanzania’s first female president, led a government procession round the casket covered with Tanzanian flag paying last respect; she communicated her condolence to late President Magufuli’s wife.
