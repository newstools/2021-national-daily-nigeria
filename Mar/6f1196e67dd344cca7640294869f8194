Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Saturday cautioned the Federal Government of a threat of civil war and that the All Progressives Congress (APC) government would be held responsible if Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State is assassinated. The Rivers governor strongly admonished that Nigeria risks being plunged into another civil war if the Benue State governor is assassinated.
Governor Wike insisted that the Federal Government should be prepared to bury Nigeria if anything happens to Governor Ortom.
The Rivers governor condemned an attempt to assassinate the Benue State governor by gunmen who trailed him to a river bank in Tyo Mu, along the Makurdi/Gboko Road in Makurdi Local Government Area, Benue State.
Wike reiterated that the Federal Government should be prepared that there will be no more Nigeria if Ortom is killed.
Governor Wike recalled how the former General Officer Commanding (GOC) 6 Division of the Nigerian Army in Port Harcourt, Major General Jamil Sarham, and the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftains, had purportedly concluded plans to assassinate him during the 2019 general elections.
The Rivers governor said the growing trend where the lives of incumbent governors are brazenly threatened is disturbing. He called for caution.
