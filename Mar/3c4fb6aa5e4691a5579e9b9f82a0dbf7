The Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria (AMLSN) has decried the proliferation of unaccredited medical laboratories especially in the rural areas.
The association says the situation was posing a threat to the health sector.
The President of the association, Prof. James Damen, made the statement in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Jos.
Damen described the situation as `very worrisome’ as most innocent persons patronized such laboratories that had no formal training on health matters and who made use of substandard equipment.
“The detrimental act of these unaccredited medical labs had led to most patients suffering hardship and pains due to inaccurate diagnosis of ailments.
“Rather than diagnosing the right ailment, the quacks issue out inaccurate results, thereby misleading the unsuspecting patients to commence treatment for an ailment he or she does not have.
“The patient rather than recovering, may develop side effects due to the  misdiagnosis which could be detrimental to the individual’s health and the actual illness in which the person is suffering from remains untreated, ’’ he said.
Damen cautioned the public, especially those in the rural areas to be wary of people who opened laboratories, calling on them to lookout for MLSCN number which showed that the laboratory had been accredited.
He urged the lawmakers to pass a bill to check the excesses of quacks, adding that under his watch as president of the association, more awareness campaigns would be carried out to sensitise the populace.
