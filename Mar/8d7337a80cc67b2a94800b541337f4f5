Israel’s President Reuven Rivlin, on Tuesday departed for Europe to lobby leaders against the International Criminal Court (ICC) decision to open an investigation into alleged crimes in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
Rivlin and Israel’s military chief Aviv Kochavi will hold a series of meetings in Berlin, Vienna, and Paris, according to a statement issued by the president’s office.
Before departing, Rivlin said the visit will focus on Israel’s call to cancel the ICC’s recent decision to launch an investigation into alleged violations of international law in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem.
The president will talk with the European leaders about “the misuse of the International Criminal Court against our soldiers and citizens,” said the statement.
The president said the visit will also focus on Iran, which Israel considers its arch-foe and Israel’s objection to the 2015 nuclear deal between the Islamic republic and the world powers.
