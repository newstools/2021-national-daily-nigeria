World footballer of the year, Robert Lewandowski of Bayern Munich FC says he is not yet turning his thoughts to retirement.
He believes he can remain at the top level with the club  for some time.
The Polish striker told the Sport Bild magazine he was aware people now looked at his age of 32, “but quite honestly: I feel better than at 26 or 27.
“I’m a better player now than six years ago.”
Lewandowski was top scorer for Bayern in every competition last season as they won the treble and leads the Bundesliga scoring chart again with 32 goals.
Scoring at a goal a game rate in the final nine matches of the season will see him break Gerd Mueller’s seemingly eternal record of 40 from 1971-72.
How long Lewandowski can maintain this form is difficult to predict, he said, “but I definitely trust myself for years to come to hold this level – at least!”
And a late career change to a softer league is also not something that appeals at this point in time.
“I can well imagine to end my career with Bayern at the highest level,” he said. “But it is still too soon for that.
“If something works well you shouldn’t end it.”
