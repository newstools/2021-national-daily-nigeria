Although the meeting held behind closed door at Government House, Port Harcourt, Mr. Kelvin Ebiri, the governor’s Media Aide, stated that Wike discussed a number of business and investment interests with Bertrand.
He said: “The meeting, on Tuesday, gave a clear indication of mutual consent on the areas of investment interests that will benefit Rivers State and the Belgium Governments.
Bertrand also told journalists after the meeting that his visit to the State was propelled by the concern to see the extent of operations of Belgium companies in Rivers State.
“This is my first visit to Rivers State. So, I want to pay a courtesy call on his Excellency, the Governor. I am here to visit the State and to visit Belgium companies existing in this area.
“There are already some Belgium companies existing in Nigeria with facilities in Rivers State. So we have some opportunities to have our facilities in gas and agriculture,’’ he said.
