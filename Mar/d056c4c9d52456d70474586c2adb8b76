Fidelity Bank has stated that it would leverage its robust digital infrastructure, bespoke product offerings and extensive partnership with International Money Transfer Operators (IMTOs) to strengthen remittances inflows.
CEO of the Bank, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe who made this known at the inaugural edition of the Fidelity Diaspora Webinar Series in Lagos, restated Fidelity Bank readiness to continually support the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) efforts to engender sustainable economic development by significantly improving diaspora remittances and foreign exchange (FX) inflows into the country.
While applauding the regulator of the financial services industry for its well-timed interventions in the FX market, Mrs. Onyeali-Ikpe stated the virtual event was part of concerted efforts to deepen engagement with Nigerian citizens’ resident abroad, providing them greater clarity on recent policy measures by the CBN and its attendant implications for diaspora investments.
“We are here today to discuss modalities of Diaspora Remittance as well as awareness of investment opportunities in Nigeria. We believe when people are armed with adequate knowledge, they will be able to make informed decisions”, she explained.
Shedding light on the investment opportunities available in the country such as fixed income securities, private equity prospects in companies, modernized agriculture, urban and infrastructure renewal projects, amongst others, she pointed out that many Nigerians in the Diaspora are taking advantage of the bank’s Diaspora Mortgage product to acquire homes in Nigeria.
On his part, Vice President Osinbajo commended the bank for the webinar session and reaffirmed his confidence in new CBN FX policy.
According to him, the policy would aid more investment from Nigerians living abroad. The Vice President, who was represented by Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Ms. Yewande Sadiku, said, “Nigerians in diaspora represent an indomitable force, they are flag bearers of Nigeria’s image, Nigeria entrepreneurial energy and Nigeria’s incredible can-do attitude.
“For several years, the remittances from Nigerians in diaspora exceeded Nigeria’s oil revenues, which translated sometimes as high as six per cent of GDP. We are interested in understanding exactly how to translate this potential to investments,” he added.
In his keynote address, Mr. Emefiele extended his appreciation to the bank for providing a platform to discuss broad issues affecting the CBN’s new FOREX policy. Emefiele highlighted the benefits of the newly introduced “CBN Naira 4 Dollar Scheme,” an initiative aimed at incentivizing senders and recipients of international money transfers.
The CBN governor explained that the new policy was expected to attract diaspora remittances through the official foreign exchange channels as well as support forex stability in Nigeria.
