Former President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, on Sunday revealed his intention to contest for a second tenure in the 2024 presidential election. Trump, reaffirming his control of the Republican Party, disclosed to the conservatives on Sunday that he is contemplating contesting for president again in 2024. He cautioned of a “struggle” for America’s very survival.
The former US President re-energized a large crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, recalling his 2016 campaign fireworks and the radicalism of his one-term presidency in the US.
Trump making his first public outing since vacating the White House on January 20, reiterated his claims that he won the last presidential election and not President Joe Biden. He berated the Republicans supported his impeachment by the US legislature.
Trump, however, told the Republican followers that he could retrieve the US president with their support, adding that he would lead the party to make a return to the White House.
According to Trump, “With your help we will take back the House, we will win the Senate, and then a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House — and I wonder who that will be?
“Who knows; I may even decide to beat them for a third time, OK?”
 
Trump at CPAC, creates a scene of a battle against Democrats’ “socialist” agenda to remake America.
He declared: “We’re in a struggle for the survival of America as we know it.
“This is a terrible, terrible, painful struggle.”
He, however, assured them of victory for the conservatives.
