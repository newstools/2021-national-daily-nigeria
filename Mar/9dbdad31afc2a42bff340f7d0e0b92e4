On the very day President Muhammadu Buhari declared the Jangebe school kidnap will be the last in Zamfara, armed bandits on transit sacked Gidan Buaushe inÂ  Maru LGA, and kidnapped eight men, 60 women and children.
Accrding to a report by the Punch, the criminal herdsmen descended on the village, and requested for food.
Having none, they then set shops and markets on fire, shooting in the air to increase the commotion.
In the pandemonium, the criminals got what they wanted, and snatched women and children numbering 60, apart from men whom they later released.
The state government and police have yet to respond officially.
On Wednesday, Buhari after a security council meeting, ordered security agents to shoot at sight anyone armed with AK-47 rifles, and other dangerous weapons.
He ordered no aircraft, especially helicopters, should fly into the state again.
