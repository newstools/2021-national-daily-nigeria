The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has raised alarm on the circulation of fake ‘Insulin tea’ taken by Diabetic patients.
In a statement released by the Director-General of the agency, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, the agency warned against buying or taking the fake tea because of its negative health implications.
“NAFDAC wishes to notify the public of the circulation of an unregistered and a fake product called insulin tea claimed to reduce blood sugar level and ‘delete’ sugar in the body.
“Please note the NAFDAC number shown on the packaging of this product (Nafdac Reg. No. 01-8662) is fake; the insulin tea poses a danger to the health of the public.
“Members of the public are implored to contact the nearest NAFDAC office with any information concerning the distribution, sale, and use of the fake insulin tea,” the statement reads in part.
She also advised those who had already bought and taken the product to report its adverse effects to the nearest NAFDAC office.
She urged Nigerians to report such incidents through the toll-free NAFDAC PRASCOR 20543 from all networks and pharmacovigilance @nafdac.gov.ng. She also stated that the report could also be made via www.nafdac.gov.ng.
