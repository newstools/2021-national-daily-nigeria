The Lagos state Police Command is set to begin fresh clampdown on commercial motorcyclists, otherwise known as Okada, across restricted areas in the state.
It would be recalled that on Tuesday, January 27 2020, the Lagos state government announced a restriction on okada, tricycles, and, by extension, bike hailing services.
The restriction went into effect less than six days after on February 1.
Out of 20 local government areas in the state, the ban affected six: Surulere, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island, Ikeja, Eti Osa and Apapa.
In a new directive, the Lagos State Police command insisted on eliminating okada riders from every part of Lagos State based on government instruction.
To achieve this, all DPOs have been directed to clampdown and stop the operation of all commercial motorcyclist (okada) within their jurisdiction irrespective of where they operate
This directive appears to override the February Lagos State Government ban of okada in selected local government areas of Lagos
Going forward, there will be high chase, seizure and arrest of okada, this is expected and some level of hostile resistance and hot friction should be anticipated
Escape tactics from the riders could lead to multiple accidents, this could lead to various degrees of casualties and some fatalities.
