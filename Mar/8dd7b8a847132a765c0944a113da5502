The All Progressives Congress (APC), Ekiti State chapter, has described the emergence of the Senator Opeyemi Bamidele as the Chairman, Southern Senators Forum, as a testimony of leadership qualities of indigenes of Ekiti.
The party said this in a statement by its Caretaker Public Relations Officer, Ade Ajayi, in Ado-Ekiti on Thursday.
“Since his election to the red chamber, Senator Bamidele has proven himself to be someone who knows what he is doing in the senate.
“The quality of his bills, coupled with his reforms at the judiciary, in his capacity as chairman, House Committee on Judiciary, has left no one in doubt as to his commitment and doggedness to ensure the survival of democracy in the country.
“The APC is equally happy that people from his senatorial district have been enjoying his robust representation at the senate as he is always in touch with them,” the statement said.
The party expressed the hope the Bamidele would use his wealth of experience to rally his colleagues in the southern part of the country to ensure that the geo political zone is not left behind in the scheme of things at the federal level.
It also admonishes the lawmaker to always display the qualities of “a typical Ekiti man” among which are total commitment and openness in all his endeavours.
“The party congratulates Bamidele and wishes him God protection as he rallies his colleagues from the south for the great task ahead,” the statement added.
