A United Nations (UN) delegation will on Wednesday begin a three-day visit to a remote Bay of Bengal island where Bangladesh has moved more than 13,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees since December.
Bangladesh wants to eventually transfer 100,000 of the more than one million refugees, living in overcrowded border camps, to Bhasan Char Island, which emerged from the sea two decades ago and considered vulnerable to floods.
The UN refugee agency said this initial three-day visit will bring together experts from UN agencies, engaged in the Rohingya refugee response in Bangladesh
“The visit will look at the current situation and facilities on Bhasan Char, appraise the needs of the Rohingya refugees relocating there, and discuss with the authorities and others currently working on Bhasan Char.”
The UN had earlier said that it had not been allowed to conduct a technical and safety assessment of the island and was not involved in the transfer of refugees there.
Bangladesh says the relocation is voluntary, but some of the first group to be moved spoke of being coerced.
The Rohingya, a minority group who fled violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, are not allowed to move off the island, which is several hours’ journey away from the southern port.
Bangladesh has dismissed safety concerns over the island, citing the building of flood defences as well as housing for 100,000 people, hospitals, and cyclone centres.
It also says overcrowding in refugee camps fuels crime, while some Rohingya said frequent violence in the camps had driven them to relocate.
“We hope it will remove any concerns that the UN has about the relocation and they will get involve in the relocation and provide Rohingya people the support they need,” a senior official at the Foreign Ministry said.
