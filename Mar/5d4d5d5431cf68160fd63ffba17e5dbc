West currently has full ownership and creative control of the Yeezy brand by himself after he previously signed a 10-year agreement to design and sell clothes under the Yeezy Gap label last year, Bloomberg adds.

Citing the document obtained by their outlet, Bloomberg noted that the new Gap line is expected “to break $150 million in sales in its first full year in 2022.”
