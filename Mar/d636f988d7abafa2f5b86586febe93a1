A pregnant student who was among the 39 kidnapped students from the Federal College of Forestry Maintenance on Thursday has pleaded with the federal government to rescue them, saying the captors want N500 million as ransom.
The plea of the student is contained in a video released by the kidnappers with the kidnapped students cowering on a forest floor as armed captors hit them with sticks.
College Provost Bello Mohammed Usman and the mother of one kidnapped student on Saturday identified those shown in the video as some of the abducted students, including the pregnant woman.
“If anybody comes to rescue them without the money they are going to kill us,” a male student says in the video as a man with a gun stands behind him.
The Kaduna state government has confirmed thirty nine students are missing after gunmen stormed the college overnight on Thursday.
It was the fourth school abduction in northern Nigeria since December.
And it showed the abductors have simply ignored President Buhari’s vow to end the serial abductions of students.
Earlier on Saturday, Kaduna state security commissioner Samuel Aruwan confirmed nine more students were missing than previously thought – 23 females and 16 males.
“The Kaduna state government is maintaining close communication with the management of the college as efforts are sustained by security agencies towards the tracking of the missing students,” Aruwan said.
Aruwan said a further 180 students and staff members who were staying at the school were rescued early on Friday.
Gloria Paul said she recognized her 20-year-old daughter, Joy Kurmi Paul, in the video, wearing a pink headscarf.
Outside the school on Saturday, the mother begged for help.
