Senator Shehu Sani has raised an alarm that the ease with which bandits attack and kidnap people with confidence even at locations adjacent to security outfits is suspicious.
Senator Sani in a tweet last weekend condemned the attack on Federal Airports Quarters, Kaduna, and kidnapping of some persons by bandits. He decried that the attack was unfortunate, adding that its occurrence near the defence academy raises questions.
Senator Shehu Sani had in the tweet, protested: “The attacks on the Federal Airport Staff Quarters, Kaduna, and the kidnapping of scores of people is tragic and unfortunate.
“The proximity of the scene of the crime to airport, security formations and the Defence Academy, raises questions.
“The terror is on the edge of our city.”
Senator Sani may not be wrong in his suspicion. The Commissioner of Police in Oyo State had at the weekend also, detained or arrested three members of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) who were part of the OPC team that arrested a renowned Fulani warlord, Iskirli Wakili, in Apete, Oyo State, who had dared Sunday Igboho to a gun battle after the Yoruba activist chased the Fulani out of Ibarapa. The police raised further suspicion in taking the arrested OPC members who surrendered Wakili to the police authorities in Ibadan to Abuja for interrogation. The action demonstrated that the police converted the innocent to criminal and the criminal to the innocent.  This episode is remarkable to the suspicion Senator Sani raised on the bandits activities in the north.
