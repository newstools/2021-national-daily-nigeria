The United Nations Population Funds (UNFPA) has medical support to 34 Vesico Vagina Fistula (VVF) survivors in Borno.
Dr Zainab Aliyu, the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) in charge of the VVF ward in Maiduguri Specialist Hospital, made this known on Tuesday in Maiduguri.
Aliyu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that so far all the 34 survivours that underwent surgical operation are responding to treatment.
The UNFPA in collaboration with Borno Ministry of Health is conducting a two-week surgical operation exercise funded by the Korean International Co-operation Agency (KOICA).
She said the exercise started on Monday with an average of four survivors being attended to each day.
Aliyu said some of the survivors came from neighbouring states of Adamawa and Yobe.
“Some even came from Lagos and Niger Republic,” Aliyu said.
She said that apart from those operated on, about 20 survivors are now waiting to be operated opon in the first of its kind exercise this year, adding that UNFPA is taking care of survivors feeding and transportation to and from their respective communities.
Some of the survivors recuperating in the ward, who spoke to NAN, thanked UNFPA for the development which they said came as a big relief for them.
Mrs Hamsatu Mohammed, a 19-year-old survivor who came from Lagos, said she was happy with the development and look foward to going back home whenever she’s discharged.
Mohammed said she developed VVF during delivery at home.
Mohammed, who is a housewife with no talent of any business, said she was willing to learn any business if given the opportunity to improve her life.
Another survivor, Mrs Hauwa Bukar, a 21-year-old from Biu town of Borno, also said that she developed the problem during child birth at the hospital.
Bukar, who is a tailor, thanked all those involved in bringing succour to them, adding that she’ is looking forward to returning to her business as tailor.
