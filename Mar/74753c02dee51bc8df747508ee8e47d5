Some Kano residents, on Thursday, lauded the state government for providing free oral health care services, as part of activities to mark the World Oral week.
The residents, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), expressed their satisfaction with the free services, hoping that the gesture would continue.
Mr Umar Sulaiman, a resident of Bichi area in Kano, said that he took his child to the Primary Health Care Centre when he noticed the free oral screening was being offered.
“I heard someone said the services were offered free and I went to indicate interest. I was counseled on the importance of checking my teeth.” Sulaiman said.
Another beneficiary, Mr Bashar Aliko, told NAN that apart from the counseling, he received a pack of tooth brush, toothpaste, and other items.
According to him, “I have identified the importance of oral health and I promised to attend dental clinics after every six months to check. “
Mrs Umma Aliyu said she benefitted from the outreach program at Rano Primary Health Care centre, where her teeth were cleaned and some drugs given to her, free of charge.
“I had some holes in my teeth and I was advised to get them refilled after washing the teeth. I have learnt the importance of oral hygiene too. ” she said.
NAN reports that the Kano state government opened a week-long free oral hygiene outreach in many primary health care centres in the state.
The outreach was in commemoration of the World Oral week  that began on Saturday, March 20, 2021 with the theme; “Be Proud of your Mouth.”
The World Oral Health Day is celebrated on March 20 every year, to spread the message on good oral hygiene and its importance to overall health.
