The All Progressives Congress (APC) has taken the membership revalidation and registration to several markets in Lagos State. Traders in big markets, especially, markets built by the Lagos State government, were being forced to register as APC members in the state. According to market sources most traders were compelled to register for APC membership, or they lose their shop allocations. Some others were alleged to receive monetary inducement to accept the membership registration for the ruling party.
The market recruitment was extended across the state; from Mushin, Agege, Ikeja, iju Ishaga, Agboju, Oluti, Abule Egba, Ifako, Gbagada, Shomolu, Oyingbo, Yaba, among other locations, APC supporters and members were said to have been on traders to register as members of the party.
Some traders said they had to avoid going to their shops for some days to avoid intimidation after the first day the party supporters visited their market asking them to register as APC members. While some traders succumbed to the pressures, several others were said to have resisted registering for the membership of the ruling party, insisting on not getting involved in partisan politics.
All the traders were, however, said to be requested to ensure they have voters’ cards.
It was gathered that APC in Lagos State is targeting over 5 million party members in the ongoing nationwide membership revalidation and registration.
Meanwhile, there were no violence in the said pressure on traders at the various markets.
