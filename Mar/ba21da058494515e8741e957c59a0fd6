The Arewa Youth Assembly, a northern youth group, has given Yoruba activist Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, 72 hours to move Yoruba people out of the north.
According to Mohammed Salihu Danlami, Speaker of the assembly, failure to do that will bring forth necessary actions.
“…by personally taking the responsibility of getting his people back home,” the statement quoted the group to have said in a statement on Sunday.
The group said Nigeria as an entity is non-negotiable, urging leaders to reject anything that would confuse the land.
“”The constitution of the country has made it crystal clear that any Nigerian can live in any part of the country, irrespective of his or her religious and tribal placements,” the group said.
Igboho had in a statement on Wednesday said the time has come for the actualisation of the Yoruba Nation.
“Starting from now, we don’t want herdsmen in our land to disturb our farms again. If we meet any killer herdsmen, we are going to face and destroy them,” he said.
“If any police attack us for that, we are ready for them. We don’t want Nigeria again, but Yoruba nation. There is no essence for one Nigeria when major resources in the country are in the hands of the northerners.
“Enough is enough, no going back… we are not scared of anybody; these killer herders are taking over our land and they are killing us,” he added
But the northern group said it will maintain its law-abiding posture, but  would not fold its arm and watch innocent Nigerians being threatened by individuals who have no regard and respect for the law.
