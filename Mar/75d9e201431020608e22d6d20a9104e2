The Management of Lagos Bus Services Limited (LBSL) on Monday commenced the deployment of the long-awaited contact-less payment system known as Cowry card.
The Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer of LBSL, Mr Idowu Oguntona, made the disclosure in a statement signed by the company’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Afolabi Olawale, in Lagos.
Oguntona said that the company would give out 20,000 free Cowry cards to appreciate trusted customers across its approved stations and routes as a mark of appreciation.
According to the LBSL boss, the Cowry Card recently introduced by the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority (LAMATA) was designed to ease the process of making payment and to make daily commuting pleasurable for customers.
“All you have to do is ‘tap-in’ at the beginning of your journey and ‘tap-out’ when alighting from the bus.
“I will implore our esteemed customers to visit our stations, register, get their cards and start using it immediately’’, Oguntona said.
He noted that the new mode of payment was in tandem with what was operational in other smart cities.
The managing director added that the move was to ensure safe, fast and secure commute across the metropolis.
Oguntona said that the use of Cowry card became necessary considering the population density of Lagos State which requires an effective transportation system.
He assured residents that the LBSL would continuously provide unique pleasurable commuting experience to its customers at affordable rates.
Oguntona also appealed to the public to take the ample advantage provided by the Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration to reduce traffic congestion in line with the T.H.E.M.E.S. agenda.
He, however, encouraged residents to imbibe the culture of using public bus transit to eliminate unnecessary traffic gridlock on roads, reduce stress and cost of maintaining their vehicles.
