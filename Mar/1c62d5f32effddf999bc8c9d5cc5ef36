Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State had at the burial of the late Emir in Kagara, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger, on Tuesday advocated for the immortalisation of the late Emir of Kagara, Alhaji Salihu Tanko.
The governor pointed out that the Emir deserved to be immortalised because of his meritorious services to the state and the country.
Bello argued that the deceased, being one of the oldest emirs, dedicated his life to the development of his emirate, the state, and the nation and as such immortalising him would be the right thing.
Governor Bello noted that the wise counsel of the deceased would be greatly missed. He called on the people to pray for the repose of the soul of the departed traditional ruler and for Allah to forgive his shortcomings.
Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, Chairman of the Niger State Traditional Council of Rulers, also acknowledged that Niger State had lost a rare gem whose positive impact would be missed.
Abubakar, who is also the Etsu Nupe, said that the entire traditional council would miss the fatherly advice of the late emir.
Other traditional rulers at the burial included the emirs of Agaie, Lapai and Minna. (NAN)
