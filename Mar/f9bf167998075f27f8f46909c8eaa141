A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmaker, and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, has declared his support for President Muhammadu Buhari on his order to security operatives to shoot anyone carrying AK-47 rifles in the country.
Elumelu, representing Aniocha/Oshimili Federal Constituency in Delta State, however, expressed that he would have proffered the President directly issuing the order than being given by his media aide. He further said that President Buhari ought to have condemned criminal activities of some herdsmen, noting that such could have sent a strong message to the killer herdsmen and their sponsors.
“The statement credited to the media aide to Mr. President is a welcome development, but I would have preferred that Mr. President himself made that broadcast.
“I would like him to outrightly condemn the activities of the herdsmen. They are everywhere messing up all the communities, attacking people.”
“His media aide making that statement is not the same thing as Mr. President making that statement himself. I would like to see more of Mr. President making that statement himself,” the PDP House of Reps. member had said.
The Senior Special Assistant TO THE President on Medea and Publicity, Garba Shehu, had revealed that President Buhari had issued directives to security operatives to shoot anyone caught with AK-47 rifle anywhere in the country.
A PDP governor, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State had also commended President Buhari on the directive. “I wish to commend Mr. President for his recent order against those bearing AK47 rifles. “This I am sure will reduce the high rate of criminality, banditry, and militia herdsmen attacks on our farming communities” Governor Ortom had declared in Makurdi.
Noticeably, governors or leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are yet to commend the President on the security intervention directive, as PDP stakeholders have been doing.
