No fewer than 1000 SUVs have been rolled out as taxis in Lagos by the State Government in partnership with the Choice International Group (CIG) Motors Co. Ltd.
The launch was held at the Lagos House, Marina on Thursday, and it was followed by the signing of an agreement for the establishment of Motor Assembly Plant in Lagos State.
According to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State Taxi Scheme called Lagos Ride is targeted at making life easier for Lagosians, improving mobility and creating a seamless multi-modal transport system.
“We are guided by the need for an equitable transport system with mobility choices for our people,” said the governor.
The former hail-ride taxi schemes, including  Uber, Bolt, and others, which believe they have been stifled by regulations, now have a government-backed scheme to compete with.
“Under the Lagos State Taxi Service, drivers/operators will be given the cars for a period of four years during which they pay a monthly installment and they will have the opportunity of owning the cars, after they have fully paid the hire amount.
“The Lagos State Taxi Service is structured along a profitability model, it is self-sustaining and able to expand and regenerate itself.”
For the Assembly Plant, Sanwo-Olu said the scheme was designed to revive industrialisation, increase citizens’ employment and wealth creation, boost tourism and encourage technology sharing, adaptation, and advancement.
He said Nigerians should expect a roll-out of vehicles from this plant within the next 12 to 18 months.
CIG Motors Group Chairman Diana Chen described the assembly plant and the taxi scheme as products of Sanwo-Olu’s business shuttle to China.
