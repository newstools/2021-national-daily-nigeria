The Director-General, Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC), Mr Folorunsho Cooker, has said that Kurra  Falls in Plateau has been captured in the 2021 budget to make it a National Treasure.
Cooker disclosed this on Wednesday when he paid a courtesy call on Gov. Simon Lalong to herald the NTDC North Central Stakeholders Forum holding in Jos.
He stated that Plateau is blessed with abundant tourists sites with Kurra Falls as one of them.
He said that the corporation was willing to invest in the rich tourism potential of the state that prides itself as Home of Peace and Tourism.
The director-general commended Gov. Lalong and the State Government for amending its laws and branding the state to boost its tourism potential.
“I want to encourage you to more than change the laws of the state by also initiating programmes that will attract investors to the state.
“We will always support you to develop your tourism potential and we will continue with the discussion to deepen the relationship between us,” he said.
In his remarks, Lalong urged the NTDC to consider developing other tourist sites when it completed that of Kurra Falls.
He told the NTDC boss that Kurra Falls was where the first hydro power plant in Nigeria if not in Africa, was sited.
He, however, said that because of lack of attention, the plant and indeed the accompanying tourists activities were at low ebb.
The governor stated that the Board and Management of the Hydro Electric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (HYPADEC) had recently visited Kurra Falls to consider ways of reviving the plant.
 He said if such was achieved, the best place for tourism to thrive would be the Kurra Falls.
“Your coming is timely, when you finish with Kurra Falls, I will invite you to come back and take another site because we have them enough,” he said.
