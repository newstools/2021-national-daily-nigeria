As groups and individuals across the nation get more agitated about self-determination, and seek Nigeria’s disintegration, V.P. Yemi Osinbajo has warned the agitators to stop.
“Nigeria is one and we believe in unity; therefore those causing problems should stop because they will not succeed,” he said at the palace of the Emir of Gombe, Abubakar Shehu, during a courtesy visit on Tuesday.
Among those he warns are his Yoruba groups mostly led by a former president of Oodua World Congress Professor Banji Akintoye, the Biafra Customary Government by ex-Niger Delta warlord Asari Dokubo, and Nnamdi Kanu’s IPOB in the southeast.
Osinbajo’s statement was coming a day after his APC national leader Bola Tinubu also insist Yoruba and Fulani are one, and Nigeria is better united.
So far none of the groups and their agitation has had any sympathy from the National Assembly of the Nigeria Governors Forum.
