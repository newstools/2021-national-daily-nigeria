Kenya’s tea exports slumped in January even as the east African country shipped the product to more countries across the globe, a report released by the Tea Directorate on Tuesday revealed.
The report shows that some 45.1 million kilos of tea were exported during the period, down from 49.2 million in December 2020.
“During the month, Kenya’s tea was shipped to 50 destinations, up from 46 in December,” said the directorate.
Pakistan remained the leading export market for Kenyan tea importing 17.4 million kilos of tea, accounting for 39 percent of total export volumes.
Other key destinations were Egypt, United Kingdom, Russia, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Yemen, and Ireland.
Tea production during the month slumped to 49 million kilos, down from 54 million kilos due to dry weather experienced in growing areas, said the agency.
