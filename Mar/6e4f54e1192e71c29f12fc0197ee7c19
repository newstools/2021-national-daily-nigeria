Mr Jude Nwankwo, Programme Manager, Anambra Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) has urged Anambra farmers to plant their crops early in 2021 to ensure early and bumper harvest.
Nwankwo made the call while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Awka.
He said farmers should not delay commencement of the 2021 seasonal farming as the rains have started early.
“Farmers should not wait any longer but rather move into their farms for massive farming to stem the tide of food scarcity that is creeping into our homes.
“The soil has been softened by the few times it rained, so farmers should begin early cultivation of crops to curb high cost of foodstuffs,” Nwankwo said.
He called on farmers that needed support for their agricultural ventures to come to his office.
Nwankwo urged all residents to support the state government‘s farming initiative to encourage mass food production in Anambra.
“Farmers that want improved seedlings should contact us to provide them.
‘’Our extension agents are there for them to guide them free of charge on the best crops suitable for their farm lands,’’ he said..
Nwankwo said that farmers could also have access to fertilizers at government subsidized rates.
“Gov. Willie Obiano is doing everything possible to make farming lucrative for participants,” he said.
