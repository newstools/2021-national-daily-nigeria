Group of Democrats in Adamawa South Senatorial District has endorsed a member of the House of Representatives, Mr Kwamoti Laori, for Senator in 2023.
Mr Peter Bokido, the group’s Spokesperson stated this at a news conference on Thursday in Yola.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Laori is representing Numan, Demsa and Lamurde Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives.
Bokido attributed Laori’s endorsement by members of the group drawn from all the nine local government areas making up the senatorial district to the lawmaker’s outstanding performance in his constituency.
“The democrats saw Laori’s outstanding achievements, leadership qualities, character and tolerance for people from different backgrounds as well as his long-standing experiences in legislation.
“Consequently, we have unanimously agreed that these qualities have qualified him to hold higher responsibilities and thus resolve to urge him to consider running for senate in Adamawa South senatorial district in 2023,” he said.
The spokesperson noted that the democrats also considered how the lawmaker had fared in various offices he had held and his achievements while in the state House of Assembly between 2007 and 2015.
