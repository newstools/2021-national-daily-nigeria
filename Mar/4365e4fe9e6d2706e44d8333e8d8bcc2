Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello may have shelved his 2023 presidential ambition to support Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
According to BBC Pidgin, Governor Bello, has not only jettisoned the idea of contesting for Nigeria’s Presidency in 2023, he has also conceded that Asiwaju Tinubu would make a better leader than himself.
The BBC Pidgin quotes Governor Bello saying “… Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu would make a strong and better youth President for Nigeria”.
There have been speculations and reports in the media that Governor Yahaya Bello will be joining the race for the power seat in Aso Rock come 2023 on the platform of the All Progressives Congress and also that Governor Bello enjoys the support of President Muhammadu Buhari.
Interestingly, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is the National Leader of the APC and it’s already loud and clear that he is gunning for the highest seat of power in the land.
Efforts to get a reaction from the Kogi State Government on this story proved abortive as at press time.
