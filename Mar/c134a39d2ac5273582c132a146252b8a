The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) on Monday announced the suspension of export receipts at Lagos ports for two weeks.
NPA Spokesman, Ibrahim Nasiru, said in a statement that the suspension was part of efforts to improve access to, and service delivery at Apapa and Tin Can Island Ports.
“The authority hereby announces a 14-day suspension of export receipts at both ports and all satellite truck parks, with effect from March 22.
“This development is necessitated by the need for consultations with export cargo stakeholders and the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) on the harmonisation of procedures required of owners of this category of cargo.
“Stakeholders should please note that this suspension does not affect export refrigerated cargo and trucks whose operators have secured call-up tickets as of March 19.
“All other segments of port users are enjoined to continue carrying on their businesses by using the designated truck parks and booking for access into the ports on the Eto platform.
“The authority thanks all stakeholders for their support towards the success of Eto since its introduction three weeks ago and seeks continued support in the determination to end truck congestion on access roads into the ports and improve service delivery,” he said.
