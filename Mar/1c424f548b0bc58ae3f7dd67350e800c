The Boko Harma terrorists in the northeast have continued to give the federal and state governments sleepless nights as their violent upsurge are daily damaging the image of the Nigerian government. The terrorists struck at Dikwa Local Government, about 90 kilometers east of Maiduguri, Borno State capital, 24 hours Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State departed after three nights habitation in Dikwa.
It was highlighted that Governor Zulum departed Maiduguri last Wednesday, after Marte was liberated on Tuesday; went to Dikwa, spending three days, then leaving on Saturday for Ngala, before returning to Maiduguri on Sunday.
The Boko Haram terrorists after waiting patiently, hit Dikwa on Monday night into the early hours of Tuesday, destroying government facilities, the Palace of the Shehu of Borno, damaging hospitals set up by international NGOs for medical interventions on victims of Boko Haram attacks.
It was gathered that the Boko Haram terrorists may have captured Dikwa, mounting checkpoint to forestall residents from escaping to Maiduguri. The Boko Haram terrorists may have more captors in their enclave as over 35,000 people who were said to have fled Marte seeking refuge in Dikwa in an earlier attack by the terrorists in Marte.
The Chief of Army staff, Gen, Attahiru, had been at the Army Super Camp 9 located in Dikwa recently where he issued 48-hour ultimatum to the troops to clear the terrorists from Marte local government. while the Nigerian military were said to have recaptured Marte, there are still fears land mines planted by the terrorists along the road. These increase the perpetual fear of uncertainty in the northeast Nigeria.
