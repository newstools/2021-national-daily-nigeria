President General Muhammadu Buhari has ordered security operatives to shoot anyone seen with an AK-47.
According to his spokesperson Garba Shehu quoting the president in an interview with the BBC Hausa, Buhari has ordered security forces to go into the bushes and shoot whoever they see with sophisticated weapons like AK-47.
“He ordered that whoever is seen with terrible weapons at all should be shot immediately.”
There has been consistent public outrage against the seeing protection many believe Buhari offered Fulani herdsmen mostly found with these weapons.
Even now that he gave te order, some Nigerians are already finding fault again.
Some expected him to make  national broadcast to this effect. Others say it is a blanket order the security forces could abuse.
