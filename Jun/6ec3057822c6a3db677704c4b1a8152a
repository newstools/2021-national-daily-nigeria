The defendants, Aaron Jeremaya, Abdullahi Umar, Abubakar Shehu, Abubakar Mamman, Mohammed Umar and Mohammed Sani, were arraigned by the Department of State Service (DSS), Ogun Command.
The defendants, whose pleas were not taken by the court, are facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, kidnapping and unlawful possession of ammunition.
The Magistrate, Mr  Dehinde Dipeolu, ordered that the defendants be remanded for 60 days in Oba Correctional Centre, pending legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).
Dipeolu, thereafter, adjourned the case until Aug. 17, for mention.
Earlier, the DSS Prosecution Counsel, Mr Emmanuel Zamba, told the court that the defendants committed the offences sometimes in April at different locations in Ogun.
Zamba said that the defendants were arrested on April 4, April 5 and April 6 at Obasanjo Hilltop, Oke-Mosan, Sagamu expressway and Ijebu-Ode under bridge.
He further said that the first defendant, Jeremaya, went to pick two AK 47 rifles from the second defendant, Umar, at Sagamu for their next kidnapping operation in Abeokuta.
He said while Jeremaya was on his way to Abeokuta, DSS personnel stopped his car at Obasanjo Hilltop, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta and upon searching the car, discovered the AK 47 rifle, thus leading to his arrest.
Zamba told the court that it was Jeremaya’s arrest that led to the arrest of Umar and other defendants.
According to him, the offences contravene Section 32 of the Prohibition of Forcible Occupation of Land Properties, Armed Robbery, Kidnapping, Cultism and other Anti-violence and Related Offences Law of Ogun, 2006.
He also said that the offences contravened Section 27(i)(b) of the Firearms Act, Cap Rll, Laws of the federation of Nigeria, 2004.
The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
