The International Press Institute (IPI) expresses concern over the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government.
It would be recalled that the federal government had on Friday suspended the operations of Twitter, the microblogging and social networking service, in Nigeria.
Government cited the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence.
The Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.

However, in a statement signed by Chairman of IPI, Kabiru Yusuf, he described the action as detrimental to the free press in Nigeria which uses twitter as a major platform.
IPI notes the concern of the government on the use of   twitter and other social media platforms to promote hate speech and disinformation. We urge twitter and other social media outfits to pay greater attention to the content they promote on their platforms which violate their own rules.
 IPI implores the Government to reverse the suspension of twitter operations in Nigeria and engage in meaningful dialogue with the social media outfit on issues of concern to the government.
