A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Gwagwalada, FCT, on Wednesday sentenced two artisans, Muhammed Shaibu and Mudasiru Mohammed to two weeks imprisonment each for threatening to kill another man.
The police charged Shaibu and Mohammed, both of Anwan Dodo in Gwagwalada, FCT, with four counts  of criminal conspiracy, intimidation, force assault and extortion.
The Chief Magistrate, Ibrahim Shafa, sentenced the convicts after they pleaded guilty and begged for leniency.
They told the court that they were under the influence of alcohol.
Shafa said that the sentence will run concurrently without an option of fine.
The magistrate maintained that voluntary intoxication was not an excuse for commission of crime.“It is a special type of madness for which the person himself is to blame. Let those who sin drink be punished when sober,’’ he said.
Earlier, the prosecutor, Mr Abudulahi Tanko, told the court that Mr Shagari Simon of the opposite National Hotel Angwan Dodo, Gwagwalada, FCT, reported the case on June 6.
Tanko said that on June 5, the convicts criminally conspired and beat the complainant and snatched some items from him.
He listed the items as one Itel phone valued N25,000, one pam sandal valued N2,700 and cash of N1,800, adding that during investigation the Itel phone was recovered from them.
The prosecutor said that the convicts also threatened to kill the complainant and throw him into the river in the area.
He said that the offence contravened the provisions sections 97, 397, 265 and 292 of the Penal Code.
