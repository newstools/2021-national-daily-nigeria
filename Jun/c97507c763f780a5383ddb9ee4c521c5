The Kebbi State Police Command had confirmed the invasion and killings by bandits in the state. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the state, Nafiu Abubakar, was gathered to have revealed that the bandits invasion occurred last Thursday, unfortunately, the incident was not made public because it occurred in the hinterlands where there is no level of awareness.
Bandits have not been operating in Kebbi State as they do in other northwest states which include Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna states and the environs.
The Kebbi PPRO, Abubakar, however, disclosed that the police are on the manhunt of the bandits.
In Kaduna State, bandits continue their onslaught, invading communities in Igabi and Chikun Local Government Areas of the State. The Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, confirming the fresh attacks, disclosed that the bandits killed five persons, while two others were injured.
The Commissioner further disclosed that a church building of the Assemblies of God was burnt by the bandits, as well as another building in the operations.
The Kaduna Home Affairs Commissioner further revealed that wives of some pastors in the Assemblies Church were also injured by the bandits, adding that they were already receiving medical treatment at a private hospital. The commissioner promised that further developments in the area will be made public.
Moreover, bandits were said to have struck in the Lambar Zango area of Kaduna-Zaria Road in Igabi Local Government Area.  They killed three travelers, injuring several others in the operation.
