Among the defectors are 27 Coordinators of the PDP Kwankwasiyya Movement in 27 states of the country, including Adamawa, Bayelsa, Osun, Kogi, Zamfara and Ekiti.
Joining these are 150,000 more defectors.
Farouk Adamu Aliyu, who represented the Acting National Chairman of the APC, received the defectors as they were handed over by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje/
“By joining our party, you have equal share, equal origin and equal respect with every other member of the APC,” the governor said.
Now, throw your red caps for destruction, because today you are born again; you are no more PDP, no more for Kwankwasiyya, but you are APC and you are Buharists,” he said.
Ambassador Olorunmi Femi, a Kwankwasiyya member from Ogun State, said he has dumped Kwankwasiyya because the movement lacks focus of the political reality on ground.
“Today, it is clear that Nigeria has a party to depend on, and as such, I am coming into the APC to join a matured political movement,” another member A.A Zaura said.
