The United States Government has expressed worries about the suspension of Twitter by Nigeria, saying the decision contradicts Nigeria’s constitution.
“Nigeria’s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The government’s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigeria’s ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses,” the US said in a statement on Saturday.
“Banning social media and curbing every citizen’s ability to seek, receive and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation and accountability has never been greater.
“The part to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts towards unity, peace and prosperity.”
Nigeria took the decision on Friday following its accusation of double standards levelled against the platform.
President Muhammadu Buhari’s post was deleted after the platform initially stated it didn’t violate its rule.
