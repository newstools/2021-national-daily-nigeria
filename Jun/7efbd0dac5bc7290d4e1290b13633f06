This is the third time a weeks the wife of the billionaire Ned Nwoko will be in hospital.
She first went under the knife in April, and went back in May for another one.
Whatever is eating has been a family secret.
But the actress has always kept her fans posted each time she checks in on admission—and even as far as the theatre.
Sharing a photo of her bandaged wrist with plaster on and several medical items in the background on INSTAGRAM, Regina posted: “Man down again” with a sad emoji.
