Share this on WhatsAppCristiano Ronaldo at 36-year-old equaled the World’s international men’s 109 goalscoring record as set by Iranian Ali Daei’s when the Portugal captain scored twice from the spot against France.
The five-time ballon d’Or award winner is used to setting records, but his latest one is one of the most significant of his career.
His 109th goal on Wednesday night made him the joint-top male international goal scorer of all time.
The remarkable feat has since generated plenty of reactions on social media – including from Daei himself:

Ronaldo scores another penalty. His 109th international goal. He’s equalled Ali Daei’s all-time record. He’s scored more goals for his country than any of the pundits in our studio (Lampard, Ferdinand, Shearer) have made international appearances.
