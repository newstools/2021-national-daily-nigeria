Zuru, comprising four LGAs , is largely a Christian population, and the worst hit among them by the bandits is Sakaba LGA.
Others are Wasagu/Danko, Fakai, and Zuru LGAs.
Sources in Taraba confirmed to the National Daily that local church buildings in Sakaba and Mansanda have been converted to dens of bandits.
“In Mansanda, if they kidnapped somebody, they take him to that church where they begin bargaining with the relations of the victims,” the source said.
‘It is as bad as that—turning our churches to kidnappers’ camps.”
Since eight police officers, including a DPO, were killed in an ambush, the local police divisions have be ordered to wait for signals from the state command’s headquarters before they respond.
“They have been handicapped. Some of them have been dismissed and even jailed for killing a wanted hoodlum,” he said.
He further alleged the government is using the security agencies, including the army and police, to further an agenda.
“There’s an army barrack here. But the soldiers are the ones giving the hoodlums cover to operate,” he said.
