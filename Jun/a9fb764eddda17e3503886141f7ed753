Airtel Africa’s shareholders lost N282.98 billion on Tuesday as the company’s market valuation crashed at the end of trading at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE).
The telecommunications company’s value was down by 10 percent after its market capitalisation dropped to N2.54 trillion at the close of business.
This was lower than the previous N2.83 trillion as some investors engaged in massive sell-off of their shares in the company.
