Share this on WhatsAppThe latest transfer news reaching National Daily reveals that Manchester United defender Axel Tuanzebe is considering leaving the Theatre of Dreams.
National Daily gathered from the report by ESPN ready to push for a loan move away from Manchester United.
The 23-year-old British-Congolese defender who is highly regarded at Old Trafford, had faced fierce competition for places and is ready to go in search of regular game time elsewhere.
A possible departure of Tuanzebe from Old Trafford will no doubt be a big blow for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who is still dealing with some defensive challenges as the Red Devils are believed to be in the market for permanent defender to partner their captain Harry Maguire.
