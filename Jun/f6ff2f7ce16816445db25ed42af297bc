Scores of Heritage Bank staff on Monday stormed the Abuja home of Senator Andy Uba over a multi-billion Naira debt owed the bank by the Senator representing Anambra South.

In a viral video posted online, the workers in branded T-shirts numbering over 20 gathered in front of what they described as Uba’s house in protest, with placards in hand.

They claimed that their jobs were on the line if the debt by the Senator is not paid following several efforts by the bank to have him pay the loan failed.


They said they felt compelled to take the action because their jobs were at stake, adding that they would likely lose their jobs if the loans were not repaid.
The voice said: “Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Today is Monday, the 21st day of June 2021, and we have here the staff members of Heritage Bank Plc,  Abuja. We are in front of Senator Andy Uba’s house in Abuja.
“Senator Uba has been owing the bank for a couple of years now, and we are here for a peaceful meeting with him, very peaceful meeting. To ask him to kindly repay those loans, because they are depositors’ funds.
“Those monies, if they are not repaid, will throw the number of the people you see here, with their families out of work. And we know the situation of the economy now. If this number of people are thrown out of work, you know what it means.
“So that people will not lose their job…”
The senator whose net worth as of February 2021 was put at $2.1 billion, has demanded a probe into rumours of his arrest over money laundering, noting that he was never arrested for any reason in 2019.
He said he was surprised when his attention was drawn to a news report in the media that he was arrested in Lagos with a huge sum of money
