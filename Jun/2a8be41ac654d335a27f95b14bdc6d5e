After months of denials and speculation, the PDP will come to accept the loss of another governor in the north to the APC.
Zamfara Gov. Bello Matawalle finally defected to the ruling APC in spite of pleas and cuddles from his colleagues.
In April, Govs Seyi Makinde of Oyo, Nyesom Wike of Rivers, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi, Darius Ishaku of Taraba, Umar Fintiri of Adamawa and Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto went pleading with Matawalle whose public statements tended to fawn on President Muhammadu Buhari.
Matawalle had assured them he was not intending to defect, though he indirectly complained of a southern PD governor that has pocketed the party.
He, however, made the move on Saturday.
“So Zamfara is back home, Welcome Matawalle,” a post by Bashir Ahmad from the presidency stated.
When te governor himself confirms it, he will become the second PDP governors in weeks that defected to the ruling APC.
His Cross Rivers colleague Ben Ayade did weeks ago.
