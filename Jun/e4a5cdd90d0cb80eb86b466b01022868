As usual, he noted the bandits are saying they were pushed into banditry by circumstances.
“If they have a genuine partner, they are ready to stop it; they are tired and want peace,” he told the Daily Post.
“As regards their ongoing activities, you realize that even when soldiers are fighting and a ceasefire is declared, it takes a long time before they stop fighting.
“We are able to see about 80 per cent of the big ones and then some small splinter groups which we could not meet because due to circumstances as we cannot go into the bush again.
“But generally, they are ready for peace, in fact, we have gathered their representatives, discussed with them, and they said they are ready but need a genuine partner. Politics is the cause of this issue.”
Gumi has been meeting and preaching repentance to the bandits. He has been largely involved in negotiating for hostage releases in some of the sensational kidnap for ransom incidents in Katsina, Zamafara, and Kaduna.
