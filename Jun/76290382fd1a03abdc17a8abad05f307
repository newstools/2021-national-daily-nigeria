The Niger Delta minister, Akpabio, after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, at the State House, Abuja, on Wednesday, disclosed that the forensic audit report on the NDDC will be presented to the president in July.
Akpabio stated that there is remarkable progress on the forensic audit, explaining that the audit was not just to clean up the mess in the NDDC but to reposition the commission for optimum performance.
The Minister emphasized that Nigeria cannot afford renewal of the crisis in the South-South as being experienced in other parts of the country, noting the importance of the Niger Delta region to the economic survival of the country.
The former Akwa Ibom State governor revealed that he has been having consultative meetings with Niger Delta stakeholders to calm tension in the region. Akpabio advocated that political leaders in other regions going through a crisis, should replicate the peace building consultative meeting to curtail restiveness.
