A local AK-47 fabrication factory uncovered by the police in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau  belonged to one James, late, and it’s being run by a technical college graduate among others.
According to police authorities two suspects believed to be behind the factory were paraded.
The names of the weapon fabricators were given as Joe Michael and Iliya Bulus.
Force spokesman Frank Mba told reporters that the suspects were arrested by operatives of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) and Special Tactical Squad (STS).
According to him, the locally-fabricated AK-47 was fast becoming the weapon of choice for criminals, and the development portends a great danger to Nigeria’s security.
Mba described the Jos-fabricated Ak-47 as a masterpiece that would require ballistic expertise to differentiate it from the ones made in Europe.
He said during the raid on the factory, 20 pieces of the gun   were recovered by the operatives, who for a long time, were on the trail of the suspects.
“We will follow up to track down those behind this, we will continue to deepen our intelligence, and continue to work with other sister security agencies to check the proliferation of illegal arms in the country,” he said.
One of the fabricators, Michael, who  attended a technical college in Jos, told reporters that he had so far fabricated about 180 units in the last three year which he sold at N80, 000 each.
The suspect also claimed that he acquired the skill from his late boss, whose name he gave simply as James.
