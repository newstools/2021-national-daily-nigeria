“Those leading and supporting agitation for the Yoruba Nation are foolish saying,” he said. “They should consider the consequences of war.”
Aregbesola said this at Zenabab Hotel, Ilesha, Osun State during the birthday celebration on Saturday.
He warned that agitators must consider the women, children, old people and those living with disabilities who are mostly affected.
“Anything that threatens and creates a problem for Nigeria may cause backwardness for our country for 50 years,” he added
According to him, Nigeria is the country that will liberate Africa from all oppressions, so the citizens must never consider a break-up as an alternative.
Ilana Omo Oodua has been at fore front of slicing off an Oodua Republic from Nigeria.
The secessionist group was founded by a historian, Prof Banji Akintoye, and foot soldiers include an ethnic jingoist Sunday Adeyemo and others.
