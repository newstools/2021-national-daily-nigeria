Days after a Dangote Cement truck crushed a motorcycle rider and his passenger to death in the Yewa South of Ogun, the company’s truck has crushed another victim to death.
This time, it was a primary school pupil, and it happened in the same LGA.
As expected, an angry mob of youth in the area burnt down the vehicle.
The Spokesman for the Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Mr Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the incident to our correspondent.
He added that the fire service truck that attempted quelling the fire was vandalized by the youth.
According to him, the incident occurred on Friday after the pupils closed from the school at Sabo Junction in Ilaro.
He blamed the driver who lost control due to speeding.
“The presumed dead victim has been deposited at the mortuary in Ilaro General Hospital.”
The company, owned by Aliko Dangote, the world’s richest black man, is notorious for destroying scores of lives through its truck regularly involved in accidents.
