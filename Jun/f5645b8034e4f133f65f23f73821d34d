According to him, the greatest threat is President Muhammadu Buhari whom he described as disease.
“If appointments are balanced. If development is even. If herdsmen and bandits kill us and are punished. If Buhari does not say “those who gave us 5% cannot be treated like those who gave us 97%”, who would talk of Oodua and Biafra?

He said Buhari has severely diminished the appetite for One Nigeria amongst Southerners. People like me, who still preach unity, are now seen as fools.
“We have three arms of government. All headed by Northern Muslim Males. We have 18 military, paramilitary and law enforcement bodies. 15 are headed by Northern Muslim Males. That is not unity. That is dominance. And I will not be dominated. That is the reason for Nigeria’s disunity. Not Sunday Igboho, or Nnamdi Kanu.
“He wants to fight unknown gunmen, but ignore known gunmen. Is it because the known gunmen share his ethnicity and religion? Fight bandits instead of behaving like a terrorist and threatening the SE.”
