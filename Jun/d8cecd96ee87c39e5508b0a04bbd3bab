The Guinness World Record holder said the extension—beyond the World Blood Donor Day marked June 14—is to allow more people join the train.
“This is to recruit voluntary blood donors who will provide safe blood and blood products for transfusion while reducing the risk of transmission of blood transmissible diseases like HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis,” a press statement by the organization said.
“This campaign is important because blood donation helps to save lives. Since blood cannot be manufactured outside the body and has a limited shelf life, the supply must constantly be replenished by generous blood donors.”
For four years, the TCIF has been at the fore front of mobilizing citizens to voluntarily donate blood.
Through this campaign the TCIF has worked in partnership with allied agencies such as the Volunteer Medical Corps, National, and State Blood Transfusion bodies including the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) and the Lagos State Blood Transfusion Service (LSBTS), corporate, humanitarian, and faith-based organizations.
The NGO is in Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 2019, and over the years TCIF has made her mark in providing support for voluntary blood donation across Nigeria, Africa, and the world.
