Leaked Emails derived by BuzzFeed using the Freedom of Information Act has exposed that Dr. Anthony Fauci lied about the origins of coronavirus, including efforts to curb it.
Anchor of “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” a Fox News commentator, Tucker Carlson, on Thursday revealed that evidence shows that Dr. Anthony Fauci has been “implicated in the very coronavirus pandemic he had been charged with fighting.”
Carlson had disclosed that Emails obtained by BuzzFeed via the Freedom of Information Act revealed that “Fauci supported the grotesque and dangerous experiments that appeared to have made COVID possible.”
It was highlighted that the emails, dated back to the early winter of 2020, show that Fauci was worried the public would think coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China.
Carlson explained he was worried “Possibly because Tony Fauci knew perfectly well, he had funded gain-of-function experiments at that very same laboratory.”
Carlson emphasized that the emails show Fauci and other top virologists shared an article from ZeroHedge suggesting COVID was a man-made bioweapon. He decried that despite it being a “plausible explanation,” ZeroHedge was banned from social media.
Carlson declared: “Until recently, you were not allowed to suggest that COVID might be man-made. Why couldn’t you suggest that? The fact checkers would not allow it.
“Why wouldn’t they? Because Tony Fauci assured the tch monopolies that the coronavirus could not have been manmade. And so, the tech monopolies shut down the topic.”
It was revealed that the emails indicated that Fauci also admitted people who have had COVID are likely to have “substantial immunity,” meaning they do not need the vaccine. Carlson protested that Fauci “has never admitted that in public.”
