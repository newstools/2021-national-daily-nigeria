According to him, ‘unknown Gunmen’ have killed no fewer than 150 security operatives and civilians so far. And no responsible government would allow such “criminal elements” to continue to have their way.
“Within these few months, they have killed 78 police officers, 38 army officers, five naval officers, seven air force officers, 15 civil defence officers, 31 community policing members,” he said during a joint media interactive session he organised with the state Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, in Owerri.
“Over 100 innocent citizens and civilians who decided not support the IPOB/ESN or refused to pay them money were also killed and properties worth billions of naira destroyed.
“With this staggering number of casualties, no serious government will stand by and watch the life of security personnel and its citizens to be destroyed. Survey reports show that 80 per cent of the security personnel killed are from the eastern part of the country.”
He promised that the government was committed to ending the activities of the hoodlums in the region.
