AGF/Justice Minister Abu Malami disclosed this Tuesday in Abuja after Kanu was brough to court in handcuffs, blindfolded.
He was arraigned for jumping bail, and the prosecutor asked the court to remand Kanu in the DSS custody.
Kanu’s last outburst was with former militant leader Asari Dokubo over fund embezzlement in the fight for the Biafra Republic.
Asari’s threat to bring Kanu down might just have coincided with the fugitive’s arrest. After all, a group of northern youth also placed a N100m bounty on his head days ago.
Malami  said the arrest resulted from the collaborative effort between security agencies in Nigeria and the Interpol
Already in custody since Sunday, Kanu, Malami said, will be taken before the Federal High Court in Abuja for continuation of his trial on charges bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, unlawful possession of firearms and management of an unlawful society.
Kanu jumped bail granted him by a federal high court Justice Binta Nyako in 2017, and fled to Jerusalem, putting his surety Sen Minority Leader Eyinanya Abaribe in problem.
The secessionist leader lost both parents between 2018 and 2019, while he was on the run.
Justice Nyako has adjourned trial resumption to July 26.
