Some stakeholders had noted that members of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) at their meeting on Monday in Abuja made no modicum of reference to the killings in the North Central zone; neither did they show sympathy for the people.
Apparently, North Central Peoples’ Forum (NCPF), building up to assert the autonomy of the zone and promote the interests of the people, on Tuesday condemned the killing of over 27 persons by bandits on Monday in Agatu, Benue State.
The Publicity Secretary of the North Central Peoples’ Forum (NCPF), Sule Dikeson, in a media interaction in Abuja on Tuesday, disclosed that the bandits invaded villages in the territory at about 5.00pm on Monday.
Dikeson protested that as leaders of the North Central region, they cannot continue to allow the mindless killings of the people continue without making moves to stop the carnage. He admonished that as the North Central is committed to the unity of Nigeria; leaders of the zone will no longer fold their arms and allow criminal elements in form of bandits, or Insurgents continue to destabilize the region.
Dikeson noted that nowhere is safe any longer in the six states of the North Central, including the Federal Capital Territory.
Also, Chairman of Publicity Sub-Committee, Tunde Olusunle, emphasized the need for effective collaboration with state actors to stem the tide of insecurity in the region.
The Forum revealed that plans have been made to convene a “Security Summit” to deliberate on the insecurity crisis in the zone.
The North Central Peoples’ Forum, therefore, assured that the zone will continue to be peace builder, committed to the unity of Nigeria.
