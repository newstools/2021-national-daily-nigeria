The leader of the Polisario movement flew to Algeria early on Wednesday morning, state broadcaster RTVE and other local media reported, citing the government in Madrid.
Ghali had been receiving treatment for the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Spain, but his stay had caused friction between Madrid and the Moroccan government, as Rabat sees Polisario as a terrorist organisation.
The medical plane took off at 1:30 am (2330 GMT Tuesday) from Pamplona in northern Spain.
Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos had already announced Ghali’s departure late on Tuesday.
“It makes no sense anymore that he stays in Spain.
“The humanitarian action has been concluded,” he told RTVE on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, the Spanish national court decided not to place Ghali in custody.
He is accused in Spain of genocide, terrorism, and torture, but the judges said there was no danger of him fleeing and found the accusers had not delivered substantial evidence Ghali had committed the crimes.
The ruling as well as Ghali’s unhindered departure could further strain relations between Spain and Morocco.
Morocco claims large parts of Western Sahara, while Polisario is fighting for the territory’s independence.
Spain, which ruled Western Sahara as a colonial power until 1975, does not recognise Morocco’s territorial claims.
