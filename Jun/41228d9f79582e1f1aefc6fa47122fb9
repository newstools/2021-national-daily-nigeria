The record is coming as the presidential task force in Abuja is not willing to dissolve the structure that has been gulping billions of naira.
The Commissioner for Health in Sokoto State, Ali Iname, after the State Executive Council meeting, disclosed that the state has been immune from coronavirus infection in the past 102 days. He added that the massive testing of citizens and residents of the state has not revealed any new case.
The Health Commissioner highlighted that cumulatively, a total of 775 persons were identified to have tested positive out of a total of 15,600 persons so far been tested in Sokoto State since the presumed coronavirus outbreak. He added that 28 persons were recorded to have died in Sokoto State of coronavirus since 2020, while there has not been a new COVID-19 death recorded in 2021.
Ther Health Commissioner, Iname, further said that a total of 27,427 persons have been vaccinated with the fist dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine in the state. The Commissioner said that the second dose of the vaccination has commenced, noting that 12,461  persons have been vaccinated with the second dose with no side effects reported.
The Commissioner, however, contradicted the state government’s interventions, saying that the government has continued to sensitize and enlighten the people on the need to continue to adhere to the COVID-19 protocol in the state. Again, the double standard of the government has become questionable. After administering second doses on the beneficiaries, why insist on COVID-19 protocols which include wearing of masks, social distancing and others, after citizens have been vaccinated.
