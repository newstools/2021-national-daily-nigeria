The Court created governor fired his special appointees amidst pressures to resign from office for failure to provide good governance in Imo State and the rising insecurity in the state since his emergence as governor from the Supreme Court.
The Commissioner for Information in Imo State, Decland Emelumber explained that the sack of the SAs and SSAs was made towards rejigging the administration.
The controversial Imo governor had earlier at a meeting with traditional rulers and Local Government Chairmen at the Executive Council Chambers of Government House, Owerri, ordered the Imo State Police Command to immediately mop up arms in the hands of unauthorised individuals.
He directed that no arms and ammunition should be found in the hands of people not authorised to hold such. He had noted that for government to succeed in the fight against insecurity in the state, security must be beefed up in the rural areas.
