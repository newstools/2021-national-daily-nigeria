Since a nationwide campaign codenamed “Tuanyuan,’’ meaning reunion in Chinese, was launched in January, police have resolved 91 long-pending cases involving child abduction or trafficking, the ministry said.
Meanwhile, a total of 236 suspects have been caught since the campaign began, it said.
During the campaign, China’s public security authorities have improved their systems and approaches, including a rapid locating mechanism for missing children and a DNA database to fight child trafficking.
Over 3,000 free blood-sampling sites have also been opened to the public recently, where missing or abducted individuals and their parents are encouraged to provide their blood samples to the police where possible.
