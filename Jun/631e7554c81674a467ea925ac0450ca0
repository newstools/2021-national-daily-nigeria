Nigerian Army troops operating as part of Operation Hadin Kai in conjunction with Air Components of the Operation have today Wednesday 2 June 2021 inflicted heavy casualties on Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) Terrorists group who launched a futile attack on Damboa LGA of Borno State.
The terrorists attacked the town in multiple waves with Armoured Personnel Carriers and 12 Gun Trucks all mounted with Anti-Aircraft Guns, as well as Locally Fabricated Armoured-plated Vehicles loaded with explosives and motorcycles.

The gallant troops successfully defeated the attack, destroyed the locally fabricated armoured-plated vehicles and neutralised over 50 ISWAP terrorists forcing the survivors to run in disarray under heavy gun fire from the resilient troops and Nigerian Air Force attack platforms.
The so-called suicide bombers had to abandon their vehicles primed with explosives as they could not withstand the overwhelming fire power from the highly motivated troops. Several weapons and ammunition were recovered from the depleted terrorists.
