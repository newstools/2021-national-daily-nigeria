The attackers are Fulani bandits who murdered the villagers and rustled their cows on Thursday.
It was not unlikely the criminals operated unhindered during the attacks that displaced many of the locals.
Since an earlier attack in an LGA in which a responding DPO and eight of his men were killed by bandits, the local police divisions have been warned to wait for signal from headquarters before they respond to any threat.
While the state police command gave the casualty figure as 66 in eight villages, a source in the area gave the National Daily the breakdown.
At Gaya, 20 men were killed; Zuttu, nine; Kanya, five; Dipindu, six; Digwengwe, four; and Cedigwenta, one person.
Other villages attacked, according to the police spokesman Nafiu Abubakar, include Dimi and Rafin Gora.
“No fewer than 800 cows were rustled,” the source added, pleading with the state and federal government to come to their rescue.
Nafiu said the state command dispatched a detachment of officers and men of the police to the area.
The National Daily reported earlier how Zuru emirate, largely populated by Christian, has been enduring attacks by bandits coming from Zamfara and Niger.
