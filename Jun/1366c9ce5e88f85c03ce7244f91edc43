The Ogun State Government has alerted residents of the State, especially those in some parts of Abeokuta, Shagamu, Ijebu Ode and other areas of imminent flash flood as it approaches the climax of the rainy season of the year.
In a statement signed by the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun, Ola Oresanya on Tuesday, the Nigerian Hydrological Service Agency (NIHSA) metrological report has predicted that Ogun State will experience flooding this year.
And knowing the devastating impact of the previous flood disaster in the State, residents of the State have been advised to prepare for flash floods during the month of July, especially between 8th and 15th July, 2021.

Oresanya also said a high intensity rainfall is being expected in September, 2021 that would result in fluvial flood because the soil would have been saturated by then and likely release of water from Oyan Dam will compound the rise in water level.
“Residents of flood prone and wetland areas across the State especially at Abeokuta South LG (i.e Gbangba, Ijaye, Ijeun Tuntun, Isale-Oja, Kuto, Amolaso, Ijeja etc), Abeokuta North LG (Adedotun, Ago-Ika, Enugada, Totoro, Onikoko etc) and Obafemi Owode LG (Adigbe, Ofada, Magboro etc) Ijebu – Ode LG (Owa River Course and Yemule River Course), Ifo LG (Isheri, Wawa, Arepo, Akute, Alagbole etc), Odeda LG (Obantoko, Arakanga river and tributaries Ewekoro, Ado-Odo/Ota, Shagamu, Ijebu – East, and Ogun Waterside are hereby advised to temporarily make provision for a safe environment to avoid severe impact of this natural event.
“Farmers around the wetlands and river banks are also strongly advised to complete their harvesting before the above stated time to avert loss of their livestock and crops to flooding.

“In addition, pedestrians and motorists in the State are advised to be cautious on the road while walking and driving to avoid accidents as the roads will witness a high volume of storm water that will subside within minutes because adequate measures have been put in place by the State Government to mitigate the potential risk at this period.

He listed some of the rivers and streams to include, Sokori stream and its tributaries, Abeokuta; Odo Musa, Mokola, Abeokuta; Arokoje Stream, Abeokuta; Orudu River, Adiyan, Ifo LG; stream within Ogungbade CDA, Onihale; Igbehin-Adun CDA, Owode via Sango, Ota; Igele River,  Ogun Waterside and Ajerogun Community Development Association, Owode via Sango, Ota.
