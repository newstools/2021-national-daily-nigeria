Nigeria’s Super Falcons have arrived in the United States ahead of a four-nation tournament, comprising Portugal, Jamaica and hosts U.S.
A statement by the Communications Department of the Nigeria Football Federations (NFF) said this on Tuesday in Abuja.
According to the statement, nine home-based players and some members of the technical crew left the country on Monday and arrived in Houston on Tuesday morning.
Mr Randy Waldrum, the team’s head coach, and a number of foreign–based players are expected to join the squad in Houston ahead of Nigeria’s first match against Jamaica at the BBVA stadium on Thursday.
The nine-time African champions will also tackle Portugal at the same stadium on Sunday before a match against four-time World Cup winners, the U.S, on June 16 at the Q2 Stadium.
The match against Nigeria will mark the first time the U.S. has ever faced the Super Falcons outside of a world championship.
It would also be just the third-ever friendly against an African country for the Americans, with the previous two coming against South Africa.
