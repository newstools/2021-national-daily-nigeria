Share this on WhatsAppChelsea have not hidden their desire to recruit the services of Inter Milan defender Achraf Hakimi.
The Stamford Bridge club were thought to have made a major boost last week when it was reported that Inter Milan were willing to take players as part of any deal to sell the Moroccan international.
Subsequently, Chelsea’s quartet Emerson Palmeiri, Andreas Christiansen, Marcos Alonso and Davide Zappacosta were touted as the players likely to be considered as part of the deal with Inter Milan to bring Hakimi to Stamford Bridge.
Disappointedly for Chelsea, the latest report reaching National Daily reveals that the 22-year-old now looks set to depart and reports in France claim that PSG have edged ahead of Chelsea.
According to RMC Sport, PSG ‘accelerated’ their talks to sign Hakimi on Friday and are now hopeful that a revised offer of €70m (£60.1m), which includes bonuses, will be enough to convince Inter.
The report further claims that Hakimi’s personal preference would be to join PSG ahead of Chelsea.
It therefore means that Chelsea are set to suffer their first transfer blow if the above latest report can be trusted.
