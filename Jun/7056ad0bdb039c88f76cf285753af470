Share this on WhatsAppDays after Sheikh Abu Gumi accused the police and the military of aiding banditry in the northwest, and the army warned him to watch his speech, the Islamic scholar has landed himself a session with the nation’s secret service.
His accusation was first aired on ARISE Television on Wednesday.
According to the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, Gumi’s sweeping allegation is not only sad and unfortunate.
“It’s a calculated attempt to denigrate the Nigerian military and undermine the sacrifices of our patriotic troops, who are working tirelessly to restore peace and stability across the country,” the army spokesman said.
“It is essential to remind ourselves that these same military, being accused of connivance, are the ones who recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of the Government Secondary School, Birnin Yawuri from kidnappers.”
Gumi has been helping in negotiating with bandits, and asking the federal government to heed the criminals’ demands. So he could have made the collusion allegation with his wits around him.
After all, the Zamfara police command as well as other states have been arresting policemen and soldiers supplying guns and bullets and protection to the bandits.
The army admitted this too.
“While the army will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep amongst its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel, as provisions for dealing decisively with such acts are crystallised in Section 45 (1) of the Armed Forces Act CAP A 20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004,” the spokesman said.
Many public commentators have criticized the scholar’s pro-bandit takes on the insecurity ravaging the north.
