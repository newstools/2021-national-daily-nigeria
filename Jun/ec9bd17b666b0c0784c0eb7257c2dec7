Until it did hours later.
While meeting with INEC chairman on Tuesday, Buhari said, “I receive daily security reports on the attacks on critical national infrastructure, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We’ve given them enough time.”
On those agitating for Yoruba and Biafra republics, the president said, “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.”
His Twitter handle tweeted this and some angry Nigerians reported their president to Twitter.
In an earlier statement Sahara Reporters quoted,  the platform said Buhari did not violate its rules.
“We’re writing to let you know that after reviewing the available information, we didn’t find a violation of our rules in the content you reported,” the company said.
“We appreciate that you let us know what happened, and encourage you to reach out again in the future if you see any potential violations.”
CEO Jack Dorsey however decided to take down the tweet, claiming rule violation
Mohammed however spoke against such decision, saying Twitter has a hidden agenda for Nigeria, recalling how the platform supported the October 20 ENDSARS that snowball into a breakdown of law and order.
“Twitter has its rules, but they are not universal,” the minister said.
