Many, from across the world, have described as a man of God, Africa’s biggest wizard, prophet, philanthropist, and angel.
The latest twist has just been added by a Nigerian actress, Jaiye Kuti.
She claimed Joshua visited her in her room when he died.
According to her on Instagram, the cleric’s spirit visited her at home in Offa, Kwara..
“I have never met you one on one but your spirit visited me when you died. I was in Offa alone in my room. My head was swollen and I saw a gentle pass of Him. There was something good about that soul, she wrote.
”Christ was poor but feeding the people and taking care of everyone. You did the same to many. I know 2 people who truly gave their lives to Christ through Him. May the Good Lord rest your soul in peace, Pastor T.B. Joshua.”
The Synagogue founder died at 57 a fortnight ago, after conducting a service in his church in the Ikotun area of Lagos.
