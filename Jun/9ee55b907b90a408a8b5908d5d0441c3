A notable stakeholders and governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State, Emeka Etiaba SAN, had on Friday written the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, notifying him of his withdrawal from the governorship primary election of the party which held on Saturday for the nomination of the party’s candidate for the Anambra State governorship election.
Etiaba in his letter of withdrawal of his candidacy, cited several court judegments and some inconsistencies in the nomination processes as reasons for his withdrawal from the process.
Etiaba had declared: “I inform you that I have decided and have indeed withdrawn my participation in the June 26, 2021, PDP primary exercise in Anambra State.
“The reasons for my decision amongst others are the judgement in suit Numbers FCT/HC/CV/7742021 delivered on 9/6/2021, FCT/HC/BW/CV160/2021 delivered on 25/6/2021 and FCT/HC/CV/497/2017 delivered 13th May 2018 which made far reaching pronouncements on the PDP Governorship Nomination exercise.”
Other reasons he cited include: “Flurry of Law Suits (Five for now) which also threaten the current nomination exercise.
“Conduct of primary election with a list of delegates compiled and targeted at achieving a programmed result.
“Conduct of parallel election by some members of the party.”
He, accordingly, declared: “It is for these reasons and more that I (as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria who appreciates the implication of the above), decided to withdraw from further participation in the nomination exercise.
“I thank you for your efforts at making the nomination exercise decent despite all pressure and interference from some party stalwarts from Anambra State and two other party stalwarts from Imo and Ebonyi states, respectively.”
