Several citizens were gathered at Freedom Park, Ojota, Lagos, in the early hours of Saturday, June 12, protesting leadership failure and bad governance in Nigeria. The protesters were peacefully expressing their disaffection with the state of the nation but about 9.15am, the police who had been drafted to the scene, started firing teargas to disperse the crowd at the Freedom Park. While people were running across the road to the other side of the venue to avoid inhaling the teargas, when suddenly the police started shooting.
A few individuals were sighted to be arrested by the police during the mix-up at Ojota.
However, no death was noticed to have been recorded. The processes are being monitored live from Lagos.
The organisers of the rally have in the past few weeks been mobilizing for nationwide June 12 protests. Apparently, the protest is going on across the country concomitantly.
The Lagos protesters, however, regrouped and remained adamant. The protesters displayed placards demanding “Buhari Must Go” and others.
In Abuja, protesters also took to the streets replicating the same demands.
