Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju Omiyinka alias Baba Ijesha is expected to be arraigned before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of an Ikeja Special Offences Court on Thursday, June 24, 2021, over allegations of sexual assault of a minor.

It would be recalled that Baba Ijesha had been in custody since his arrest on April 22.

The popular actor was initially arraigned on June 16 at the Yaba Magistrates’ Court on charges of indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault.

But he pleaded not guilty to the charge and was however ordered to be remanded in custody by Magistrate P.E Nwaka due to indications that the matter is before the High Court.

According to Magistrate Nwaka, ”I  have carefully considered the application of the counsel to the defendant seeking bail for the defendant and the opposition by the counsel from the DPP.

“Since there are indications that the matter is before the high court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given.

“The defendant must be accorded full medical attention by the authorities pending his arraignment at the High Court.”
