As US, UK, EU, Canada intervened

President Muhammadu Buhari may have succumbed to pressures from the diplomatic community to reverse the ban on Twitter operations in Nigeria. Accordingly, after the intervention of Envoys   from the Untied States (US), United Kingdom (UK), European Union (EU), Canada and Northern Ireland on Monday,  the Nigerian government gave conditions for the reversal of the indefinite suspension of Twitter operations in the country.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, at a meeting with envoys from UK, US, EU, Canada, and other countries in Abuja on Monday, said that the condition is that social media platforms must ensure it is used ‘responsibly’.
The minister was, however, not specific on the date the ban will be set aside.
According to Onyema: “The condition would be responsible use of social media and that really has to be it.
“We are not saying that Twitter is threatening the country or any such thing.
“Why we have taken this measure is to stop them to be used as platforms for destabilisation and facilitation of criminality or encouragement of criminalities.”
