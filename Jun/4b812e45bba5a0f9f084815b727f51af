Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu,  on Tuesday described the death of Prophet Temitope Joshua, who died last  Saturday at 57 as painful.

This is contained in a statement signed by  Sanwo-Olu’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Gboyega Akosile,  and made available to newsmen in Lagos on Tuesday.
He said that the death of the founder of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations, a Christian megachurch, came as a rude shock.
He urged the family of the deceased,  friends, associates, Church members,  the people and Government of Ondo State,  to take heart and accept it in good faith.
According to him, no doubt that  the death of a loved one is usually painful as it is irreparable but all must always take solace in God.
”This is especially true if the deceased had lived a good life, just like Joshua, who impacted people within and outside the shores of Nigeria positively.
”The pastoral, wise counsel and philanthropic gestures of Joshua will be sorely missed by all.
”His philanthropic gesture will be missed by the less privileged and the entire members of the Church,  especially,  in Ikotun axis of Lagos State, where he played active roles as a cleric and a  philanthropist.
”I pray that God will grant the late Prophet  eternal rest and grant his family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” he said.
