Days after the federal government suspended Twitter operation in Nigeria, the No 3 citizen of Nigeria decided to break his silence during the second anniversary of the 9th Senate June 11.
Sen. President Ahmed Lawan said Nigeria and Twitter need one another.
“Our belief is that Nigeria needs Twitter just as Twitter needs Nigeria,” he said.
“Our expectation is that we will be able to resolve this issue.
“But beyond that, I am optimistic and I believe that all of us would have learnt our lessons.
He gave assurance that the nation would overcome its security challenges.
” I believe this is the worst level we could get to. We cannot go beyond this level, it could only be better.
“I believe we are going to gave a reversal of this situation very soon. We shouldn’t despair, we shouldn’t be despondent. We should have hope and optimism that our situation will be better.”
