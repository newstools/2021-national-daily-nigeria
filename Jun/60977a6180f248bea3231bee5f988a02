A document leaked to People Gazette revealed a transfer of N136 million from the CBN to the company in 2019.
That amount, the online new platform said, was one of many transactions between the apex bank and Garba’s IPI in the last two years.
“We do projects and receive payments from the Central Bank. I think it is a project we did for the EFCC,” Garba said, reacting to the leak.
“Crowwe was “100 per cent developed by us internally. We are even looking for investors locally and internationally. We are looking for investors to further scale up and improve Crowwe capacity.”
The platform has sought to power out in the wake of the Twitter suspension in Nigeria. But technical glitches and inadequate bells and whistles have rendered the app non-competitive.
Google Playstore had to take it down days ago, stating violation of policies.
Since the stand-off between the federal government and Twitter began—over what the government described as the platform’s double standards—at least three apps have been introduced to Nigeria.
Immediately after the suspension, Koo, a social media platform from India, was introduced to the Nigerian audience, the National Daily reported.
Last week, Tribe Naija, another home-made platform was launched in Abuja.
The promoter is Kola, the son of the late President M.K.O Abiola.
