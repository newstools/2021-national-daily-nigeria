The rejection of the bail application was made known by the lawyer to the embattled actor who made it known that the magistrate has no jurisdiction as regards the bail because the government has filed the case at the high court.
His arraignment is not unconnected to accusations of molestation of a minor levelled against him by friend and colleague Comedienne Princess.
According to the story, Baba Ijesha who is a regular visitor to the house had allegedly been sexually involved with the minor under the Princess’s roof without her knowledge and consent.
