Share this on WhatsAppThe Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) has unveiled details of the burial arrangements for Prophet T.B. Joshua, founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, who died on June 5. The Church is solely taking responsibility for the funeral in defiance to the traditional ruler of the prophet’s local community who insisted that T.B. Joshua must be buried in his country home in Ondo State.
However, while The Church announced the activities of the one week funeral from July 5 to 11, the leaders were silent on the venue or location of the final rest of the Prophet.
The funeral details as provided by The Church were posted on the Instagram at the weekend by Dele Momodu, a friend of late Prophet Joshua.
Prophet T.B. Joshua was born on June 12, 1963 and died on June 5, 2021.
