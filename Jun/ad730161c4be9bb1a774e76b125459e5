Share this on WhatsAppFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Senator Shehu Sani, in different tweets some hours after indefinite suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria, mocked President Muhammadu Buhari over the ban on twitter.
Atiku, without a clear critical statement, expressed the assurance that the #TwitterBan cannot restrain him from tweeting, suggesting there are alternative means of accessing twitter services. Atiku, accordingly, on his official twitter handle @atiku, stated: “Hopefully, this isn’t my last tweet #smile.”
Senator Shehu Sani, a member of Eight National Assembly, also on a separate tweet suggested alternative means of accessing twitter services despite the #TwitterBan by the Buhari administration.
The former senator advised twitter users, particularly, in Lagos, to go to Nigeria’s borders with Benin Republic, do their tweets and come back; indicating that the #TwitterBan cannot hinder twitter users from accessing the social media services.
Shehu Sani without critical statements like Atiku, tweeted on his official handle: @ShehuSani “If you live in Lagos and want to tweet, just go to Cotonu, tweet and come back.”
The Nigerian government had last week suspended twitter operations in Nigeria indefinitely after the organization deleted a post by President Buhari for contravening community rules.
