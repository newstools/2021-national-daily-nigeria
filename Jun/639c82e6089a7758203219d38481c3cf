The National Daily reported how Dokubo  called Kanu a con man, promising he would bring him down in the cause of fighting for the Biafra nation.
“Nnamdi Kanu, I’m not in your category but for this, I will surely bring you down. I will destroy this evil empire that is working as a hindrance to the restoration of Biafra,” he said in video that trended June 17.
Reacting, Kanu warned Dokunbo, who he recently announced as the leader of the Biafra Customary Government, to stay away from the agitation.
“When world leaders or respected commentators talk about Biafra, I respond. I can’t dignify a petty pipeline security guard with a response. He should focus on his business ventures and leave freedom fighting to freedom fighters, Kanu wrote in his response June 18.
“For a man of his bloated stature to belatedly realise that his father is Fulani, tells you all you need to know about him.”
