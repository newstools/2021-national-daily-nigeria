However, it was understood that both Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain have made £51.6m (€60m) offers for the Spanish born Moroccan international, but Inter want at least £68m (€80m) as revealed by Sky Sports.
Interestingly for Chelsea, Inter are now willing to take players as part of any deal to sell the former Real Madrid defender as Marcos Alonso and David Zappacosta are being discussed during negotiations National Daily currently learnt.
It has been further understood that the reigning Serie A champios have also joined Emerson Palmeiri and Andreas Christiansen as options – and Sky in Italy are reporting that Alonso in particular is a name Inter are warming to, along with Zappacosta.
With the above latest development, it becomes seemingly a possibility for the Blues to finally strike a deal that will enable them bring their transfer target to Stamford Bridge this summer to the excitement of their fans as Inter Milan are in need to make significant financial cuts following the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to Conte leaving his job just last month.
