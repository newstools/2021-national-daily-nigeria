Following the murder of APC chief Ahmed Gulak, many have been asking what took the former presidential adviser, incognito, to a state where he was kidnapped in 2018, and is now a den of secessionist bandits.
The police command in the state said it wasn’t aware of Gulak’s presence and movement until he was waylaid on the road to the Sam Mbakwe International Airport, and shot dead on being identified by gunmen suspected to be IPOB.
But while members of the Senate on Tuesday observed a minute’s silence to mourn Gulak, rhe deputy Sen Ppresident Ovie Omo-Agege revealed the late politician was on national assignment.
According to him, Gulak went as on behalf of the Senate Committee on Constitution Review.
“The late Hon. Ahmed Gulak was a very committed, dedicated citizen of this country. Very distinguished politician, who made tremendous contributions at both the state level in Adamawa and the National Level,”  said Sen. President Ahmed Lawan.
“The murder of this Nigerian is something that our security agencies must unravel the murderer and the people behind the murder itself. This is necessary in all the murders and assassinations that take place in our country on almost a daily basis.
“Our security agencies, particularly our intelligence agencies must continue to fish out such issues even before they happen.
“Let me also join you in praying for the soul of Late Ahmed Gulak and also condole with his family, his State Government and the people of Nigeria.”
