Amnesty International Researcher, Anietie Ewang, argued that “this repressive action is a clear attempt to censor dissent and stifle the civic space.”
The principal victim, Twitter, expressed that the indefinite suspension by the Nigerian government was “deeply concerning”; saying: “We are investigating and will provide updates when we know more.”
The UK’s deputy high commissioner in Nigeria, Gill Atkinson, also berated the Nigerian President for the #TwitterBan, warming: “any action taken by government must be measured, proportionate and not suppress basic freedoms.”
Twitter had recently established its African Headquarters in Ghana, an investment decision that precipitated uproar in the country and criticism of the Buhari administration for making the Nigerian economy not conducive to business operations.
