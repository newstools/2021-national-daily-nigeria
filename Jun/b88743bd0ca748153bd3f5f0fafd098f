Governor Sanwo-Olu in a statement issued on Monday by his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, described Fashola as a seasoned administrator, legal icon and technocrat who has used his skills and positions in different capacities for the growth of Lagos State and Nigeria.
He said Fashola raised the bar in corporate governance and administration while serving as Governor of Lagos State, with great records of laudable achievements during his eight years tenure.
Sanwo-Olu wished Fashola more years of joy and good health for a continued service to the State, Nigeria and humanity as a whole.
Governor Sanwo-Olu in the statement declared: “On behalf of my adorable wife Ibijoke, the good people of Lagos State as well as the All Progressives Congress (APC), I heartily congratulate my brother and predecessor, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN), on the occasion of his 58th birthday.
“As a true ambassador of our dear State, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN), set a high standard in the administration of Lagos State with great achievements and laudable projects, which are visible in different parts of the State.
“Mr. Fashola has sacrificed the greater part of his life in service of Lagos State and Nigeria. He served passionately as Chief of Staff to former Governor Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and his track records earned him the governorship seat in 2007 to continue on the progressive path set by his predecessor for eight years before moving to the federal level in 2015 to serve as Minister of Power, Works and Housing.
“His contributions to the success of the All Progressives Congress-led government at state and federal levels are commendable. He is Lagos State pride in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.”
