The three-time Grand Slam champion, Murray who hobbled out of 2017 Wimbledon in the men’s singles quarter-finals against Sam Querrey has not made  return since then.
The current British number 23 and world number 839 will be facing Georgia’s 24th seed Nikoloz Basilashvili on his return.
Meanwhile, Roger Federer who was the champion in the last singles event Murray featured will be targeting to add to his eight Wimbledon titles when he begin the chase against Adrian Mannarino.
Novak Djokovic who recently won the Roland Garros will be lurking around the corner to add to his five Wimbledon titles that he last won in 2019 when he faces British wildcard Jack Draper, who burst onto the men’s scene at Queen’s with a run to the quarter-finals.
There is no doubt that Djokovic who has previously won both majors so far in 2021 will be looking forward for an opportunity to capture the Golden Slam, by winning Wimbledon, the Olympic Games and the US Open.
Deplorably, Grand Slam champions Rafael Nadal, Juan Martin del Potro, Stan Wawrinka and Dominic Thiem have already pulled out of the event.
The tennis fans are already geared for the Wimbledon showdown which runs from Monday, June 28 through Sunday, July 11 2021.
