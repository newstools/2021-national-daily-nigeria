President Buhari at the official visit on Thursday affirmed that the government will sustain its investment in the Armed Forces. He further promised better welfare for the military personnel in the battlefield with the terrorists, including ‘insurance’ cover for families of demised soldiers in the battle.
The President added that the nation will remain indebted to the patriotic commitment of personnel of the Armed Forces and security agencies, to the defence of the fatherland against insurgency and criminality.

He acknowledged all the security personnel who made the supreme sacrifice in ensuring that Nigeria remains one indivisible and secure entity.
President Buhari promised: “This administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country are well catered for.”
The President noted that several interventions by the federal government have led to the procurement and delivery of large consignments of critical combat enablers, including high calibre weapons and ammunition.
He assured, “Much more equipment will be procured for the Armed Forces to cater for both the short and long term requirements.”
President Buhari encouraged the Armed Forces and other security agencies that there is still a lot of work to be done to completely restore peace to the northeast, stem banditry in the northwest and North Central, as well as deal with other security challenges across the country.
