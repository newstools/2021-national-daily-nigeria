The Nigeria Air Force has recorded successful bombardments of bandits terrorizing some parts of Niger during an air operation on the weekend.
Many bandits fleeing Genu in a convoy with herds of cows were also killed.
NAF Director of Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet told PRNigeria that the airstrikes at the axis were very successful.
“Our mission is against armed bandits in that Genu axis, after we got intelligence on bad elements planning to terrorise the people,” he said.
The fighter aircraft was deployed from a military base in Katsina State.
But a bomb allegedly hit a wedding party in an adjoining community.
“Two villagers were killed unfortunately. We gathered that several others who were guests at the wedding feast, sustain injuries,” an eye witness said.
But NAF authorities said their targets were the bandits, and the air raids hit the targets.
