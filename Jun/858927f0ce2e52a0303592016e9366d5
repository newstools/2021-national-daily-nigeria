Former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, at the weekend commended the governorship aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State for their hard work in sustaining the party in Anambra State and participating in peaceful and successful primary election last Saturday. Obi enjoined the aspirants and the emergent governorship candidate of the party for the governorship election in the state that the election had come to an end but the real work for power has started.
He congratulated Val Ozigbo who won the PDP ticket, acknowledging the hard work and sacrifices other governorship aspirants made towards participating in the election. He appealed that they should not consider the gubernatorial primaries “as the end of the beginning, but rather the beginning of the end.”
Obi declared: “I thank the National Chairman who, together with his leadership, has remained neutral. I congratulate the PDP family in Anambra State who has given the state  the most peaceful and organized process of choosing a candidate.”
the former governor and PDP vice presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, urged the PDP stakeholders in Anambra State and beyond to pull together as a family towards “a  journey of building a better Anambra State for  the future of our children and the true “light of the nation.”
