BNL fighters in those areas recently issued a quit notice to companies operating there, alleging Nigeria gets 60percent of the oil in the region and uses the money to “sponsor” the Nigerian military against secessionist.
The groups accused the federal government of “killing armless pro-Biafra supporters in Imo State and Rivers State”.
