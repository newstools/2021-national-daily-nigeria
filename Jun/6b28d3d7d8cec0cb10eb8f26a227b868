There’s also high possibility of traffic robbery across the State due to potential gridlock as envisaged.

Individuals in Lagos are therefore advised to monitor developments to the situation, and anticipate heightened security presence and traffic disruptions, allow additional time to travel and obey all instructions issued by the local authorities.



The last time President Buhari visited Lagos was on April 24 2019, and heightened security measures were put in place as many traffic routes were diverted to allow the president to travel through the city.
