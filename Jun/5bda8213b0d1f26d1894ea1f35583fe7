Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State had in Makurdi refuted insinuations of rift between and President Muhammadu Buhari. While disputing being at loggerhead with the President, the Benue governor, however, admitted only disagreeing with the president on public policy.
Ortom at a media briefing on Democracy Day, highlighted some achievements of his administration in spite of the economic and security challenges in the country.
Governor Ortom appealed for external support to contain the persistent herder attacks and killings in the state, raising alarm that the insecurity crisis has gone beyond the control of the Benue State government.
Governor Ortom unequivocally declared that Benue State will not be part of the federal government’s plan to reopen grazing routes across the country. He argued that such practice is no longer feasible in the 21st century civilization.
The Benue governor maintained that the north has sufficient land mass to develop grazing fields that would accommodate the herders. He argued that the insecurity associated with open grazing is enough reason to discourage the practice in Nigeria
