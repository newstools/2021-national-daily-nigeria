A northern group, Arewa Mandate Initiative, has expressed readiness to support a Southern candidate for the 2023 Presidency because it is committed to the idea of rotating the Presidency between the North and South.
The group in a statement on Sunday listed 11 candidates it will be willing to support, including Bola Tinubu, Kayode Fayemi, Raji Fashola and Rotimi Amaechi, should any of them run for President.
The statement signed by the Coordinator, Muhammed Mubarak, and Secretary, Aminu Muhammed, in Abuja, titled, ‘The North Is Ready For Power Shift To The South In 2023,” said after consultations across numerous political groups, especially on the platform of the All Progressives Congress in the north, it concluded that the next President of Nigeria emerged from the southern part of the country.

“Among those that the North might be looking out for, include, the current Minister of State, Petroleum, Chief Timipriye Sylvia, from Bayelsa State, the current Minister of Transport, Chief Rotimi Amechi, from Rivers, and Senator Victor Ndoma Egba, a former Senate Leader and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, from Cross River state, all from the South-South.
