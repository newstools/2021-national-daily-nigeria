Share this on WhatsAppSenator Peter Nwaoboshi, representing Aniocha North, Delta State, in the Nigerian National Assembly, has won the N322 million money laundering suit filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) at a Federal High Court in Lagos. The court, accordingly, discharged the senator of the N322 million corruption suit.
The presiding judge, Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke, had in his judgement declared that the EFCC failed to prove the elements of the offences for which the commission was prosecuting the senator.
Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke further discharged the two firms – Golden Touch Construction Project Ltd and Suiming Electrical Ltd – belonging to Senator Nwaoboshi, also prosecuted with the Senator by EFCC, on the same ground.
Senator Nwaoboshi and the two firms  were arraigned before Justice Mohammed Idris in 2018 before the judge was later promoted to the Court of Appeal. Thereafter, the suit was reassigned to Justice Aneke for further arraignment on October 5, 2018.
It was highlighted that in the two-count charge marked FHC/L/117C/18., the EFCC accused the senator and his two companies of committing the offence between May and June 2014, in Lagos.
The EFCC alleged that Nwaoboshi had acquired a property described as Guinea House, Marine Road, Apapa, Lagos, at the cost of N805 million.
The commission argued that the senator reasonably ought to have known that N322 million out of the purchase sum formed part of the proceeds of an unlawful act.
The commission said the money was transferred to the vendors by order of Suiming Electrical Ltd.
Suiming Electrical was alleged to have on May 14, 2014, aided Nwaoboshi and Golden Touch to commit money laundering.
The presiding judge, Justice Aneke, however, stated that the prosecution’s case failed because “bank officials were not called to testify.” Thus, the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.
