“Mr President used the opportunity to congratulate him for this appointment, and to call on him to ensure that he does not betray the confidence reposed in him by Nigerians.’’
The IG-P, who also spoke to the correspondents, said he later briefed the council after his confirmation, on security developments across the country.
He pledged to work assiduously to ensure that the responsibilities assigned to him were executed satisfactorily.
