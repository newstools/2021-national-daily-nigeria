Share this on WhatsAppFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar has reacted to the viral stories of a joint presidential ticket with CBN ex-Gov Charles Soludo as his running mate for 2023.
The duo were pictured in campaign posters posters surfaced in Abuja on Monday.
In a statement released by his media office and signed by his media aide, Paul Ibe, Atiku said he knew nothing about the posters or those who may have promoted it.
“Ordinarily, we would have ignored the reports, but for the interest of those who may be misled by the disingenuous plot.
“It is obvious that this is a work of mischief. For the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar is of the PDP while Charles Soludo is of APGA. It is silly of anyone to attempt to drag the former Vice President into an election in Anambra which outcome will be determined by the people of the state.
“Atiku Abubakar is presently preoccupied with joining hands with other well-meaning Nigerians to help in finding solutions to the myriad of challenges plaguing our nation such as insecurity and economic downturn marked by joblessness and extreme poverty.
“That explains why last Monday, the Waziri of Adamawa commissioned the headquarters of Standard Micro Finance Bank and two manufacturing plants, promoted by him in Yola to provide much-needed jobs and opportunities.
“We wish to restate that the purported 2023 campaign posters in circulation linking Atiku to Soludo, is the handiwork of mischief makers and should be ignored.”
There have been political permutations as to how the PDP will feature its presidential flag bearers in 2023.
But the southeast, demanding the presidency rotate to the region, prefers an Igbo politician as the presidential candidate.
Atiku ran in 2019, with Anambra former Gov Peter Obi, a PDP defector, rom the APGA, as his running mate.
