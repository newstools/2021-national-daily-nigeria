The 37 years old South African woman, a mother of six years old twins, delivered the 10 babies, comprising of seven boys and three girls through Caesarean Section on Monday, June 7, 2021, in a hospital in the country.
Gosiame attested that her pregnancy was natural, not induced by fertility simulation that encourages multiple baby births in modern science.
Gosiame added that she had anticipated to have eight babies but succeeded in having 10.
Gosiame delivery of 10 babies in one birth erased the record set by a Malian woman in May 2021 who gave birth to nine babies in one delivery.
Curiously, Gosiameâ€™s husband, Teboho Tsotetsi, is currently out of job but he welcomes the babies with joy and optimism.
Meanwhile, humanitarian organisations worldwide are expected to help or any form of intervention to make the children live and sustain the world history set by the South African woman.
