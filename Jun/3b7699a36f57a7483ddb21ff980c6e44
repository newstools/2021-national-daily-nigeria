The Presidency has clarified its stand on the controversial Media Amendment Bill, stating that contrary to speculations, President Muhammadu Buhari has nothing to do with the bill.
Presidential aide on Media, Femi Adesina stated this in a statement issued to react to widespread criticism over the Bill which many described as an attempt to muzzle the media.
According to Femi Adesina, the President has nothing to do with the ongoing attempt by the House of Representatives to amend the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Act and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act.
He made this clarification while fielding questions from State House reporters after the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday.

Adesina further noted that only the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, could speak on the matter.
When asked to comment on the issue, Adesina said: “That’s not strictly a Presidency thing because the president has nothing to do with that. It’s a government thing and it’s the Minister that can talk about it. So, thank you.”
The aide also explained that the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, was studying the ruling issued by the ECOWAS Court over the suspension of Twitter services in the country.
