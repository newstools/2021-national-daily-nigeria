It is likely that the 15-member UN body will vote in favour of the 72-year-old Portuguese diplomat.
In the past few years, Guterres has managed to maintain good relations with the powerful veto powers, the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France; moreover, there is no official opposing candidate.
A council recommendation is considered a crucial hurdle for Guterres to be confirmed by the General Assembly for another five years in the highest UN office.
A session of the General Assembly is expected before the end of June.
The UN chiefâ€™s new term is scheduled to start on January 1, 2022, and last for five years.
The previous nine post holders were all men, four of them came from Europe.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Guterres secured the position in 2016, going through a reformed selection process that included a public informal dialogue session in the General Assembly, involving civil society representatives, where each of the 13 candidates presented vision statements, and took questions.
NAN reports that in accordance with Article 97 of the UN Charter, the appointment is made by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Security Council, which in effect means that any of the five permanent members (P5) can veto the nominee.
Each Secretary-General has the option of a second term, provided they can muster enough support from the Member States.
