Share this on WhatsAppDays after President Muhammadu Buhari’s speech was allegedly twisted to mean a dig at his party man and national leader Bola Tinubu, there has been a solidarity response from some quarters to make a political statement.
Tinubu’s supporters didn’t just stop at amplify the residential statement denying Buhari hit Tinubu with the statement:“You can’t sit in Lagos and determines how the party runs; they have gone ahead to pile more pressure on the former governor to declare intention for the 2023 presidency.
Posters screaming “TinubuNe”, Jagaban Nigeria”, “Happy Democracy Day, Tinubu Advocates Group,” have flooded the Maitama District, Central Business District, and areas around the APC national secretariat in Abuja.
Although Tinubu hsnt declared he wants to run for the nation’s top job in 2023, but groups and supporters have sprung up claiming they want to compel him to run.
According to the national president of the group that sponsored the posters on Sunday, the peace, love, unity and harmony of this country has never been disturbed like this.
“All this is happening just for those crooked politicians to disorganize us, but unfortunately for them we have gone far ahead of all their evil strategies,” said Abdulhakeem Alawuje, who spoke to reporters in Abuja.
“We are supporting Tinubu and calling on him, begging him, inviting him to contest the 2023 presidential election for the benefit of Nigeria and Nigerians.
“You can believe me that Tinubu has laboured so much for the development of this country. We all know how he laboured to give us President Muhammadu Buhari.
“We need continuity. We need somebody that will continue and consolidate on the achievements President Buhari is making. We need somebody that knows the house, and that is Bola Tinubu.”
Tinubu, who holds the ace in the southwest, has some of his kinsmen, including Ekiti APC Gov Kayode Fayemi, eyeing Aso Rock, too.
But none of them has made the intention known.
