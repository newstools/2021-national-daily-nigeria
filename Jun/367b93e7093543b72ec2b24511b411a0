Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has bemoaned the fate of Nigeria as the most populous black nation struggling to reach its potential.
While admitting the country is destined to be a land flowing with milk and honey, he blamed bad leadership has made it unachievable.
“My prayer is that all of us will have something to contribute to making this country what God has created it to be – a land flowing with milk and honey,” Obasanjo said Thursday at a book presentation in Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta..
“Right now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness, that is not what God wants this country to be.
“We must change the narrative, we must talk to ourselves in the civilised language.
“There is nowhere you go in this country that you will not see geniuses in any section of the country. So, why should we look down on ourselves?”
The book titled, ‘The Man, The General and The President,’ is authored by Femmy Carrena.
Nigeria has been reeling in the pangs of insecurity since 2016, and the situation has been since October 2020.
