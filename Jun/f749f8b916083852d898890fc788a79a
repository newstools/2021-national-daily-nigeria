Share this on WhatsAppEdo Gov Godwin Obaseki just won his Supreme Court victory, and put the APC to silence. But a rumpus he created when he defected to the PDP amidst guber primary is getting louder and claiming victims.
The state party chairman Tony Aziegbemi just earned himself suspension following the revelations he kept the $120,000 Obaseki gifted him during his defection. He allegedly cornered N7 million from the governor again, and the party had none of it.
Aziegbemi had other issues with the party, though: he was taking o the three musketeers—party elders Raymond Dokpesi, Tom Ikimi, and Mike Oghiadome.
He accused Obaseki of surrendering the party to the three.
But it has all turned against Aziegbemi now
In a press release the PDP made available on Wednesday in Benin City, the party’s Publicity Secretary, Chris Osa Nehikhare said the suspension was a resolution reached by the State Working Committee.
The suspended chairman was accused of gross misconduct by brewing unnecessary tension and disunity among party members in the state, a manner akin to bringing the party into disrepute.
Ignoring this allegation would be like ignoring the elephant in the room, he said.
“This macabre dance must not be ignored as Edo people have watched in utter amazement and disappointment how Dr Tony Aziegbemi has been roped and entangled by his actions and unfortunately too, his inactions in the management of the affairs of the party.
“As a disciplined party, we pride ourselves as organised and focused on service delivery to our teeming supporters and of course Edo people.
“We urge our members and supporters to please remain calm as we embark on this self-cleansing exercise.
Deputy chairman Harrison Omagbon has been directed to step in acting capacity pending when the allegation levelled against Dr. Aziegbemi would be investigated and resolved.
