Share this on WhatsAppThe transfer speculation of the Norwegian wonderkid Erling Haaland away from Borussia Dortmund is not new to the media.
The 20-year-old former Red Bull Salzburg goal machine has previously been linked with a number of world’s top clubs since his move to Borussia Dortmund in 2020 where he has since become one of the world’s proficient strikers.
It was recently reported that Haaland’s agent Mino Raiola held talks with both La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid as the transfer battle of the former Molde young star intensified.
However, Haaland whose father was a former Man City player could be following on his father’s footsteps by heading to the Etihad as his “new agent” Riyad Mahrez could be prepared to bring him on board.
A video has emerged on social media on Monday, showing Haaland and Mahrez enjoying themselves while on holiday, with both waving napkins above their heads as music played.
However, presumably to avoid any sorts of trouble for tampering with another club’s player, Mahrez was quick to clarify that he was only joking, saying: “just having fun calm down.”
Mahrez further responded to the video by teasing fans saying “Agent Mahrez on duty”.
The Algerian international was quick to rile up fans on social media by hinting about Haaland’s future before pointing out that he was, in fact, joking.
