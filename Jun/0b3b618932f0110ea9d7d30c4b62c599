Share this on WhatsAppThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has slammed President Muhammadu Buhari for weak prosecution of the anti-corruption war in the country. The opposition PDP berated the President for partisan sympathy, subtly shielding members of his political party, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), accused of corruption from proper investigation or prosecution.
The PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbodiyan, emphasized that President Buhari’s fight against corruption in the country is a circus show in which looters are allegedly permitted to go untainted and free after fleecing public funds.
The PDP pointed out the case of a recent indictment of an unnamed female minister who was accused of purchasing a property worth $37.5 million who was not made to account for the alleged impropriety.
The party also challenged  the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, “to without delay name the culprit and stop the famous process of easing out corrupt persons in President Buhari’s cabinet.”
The party urged the EFCC to be transparent in its operations.
The PDP further scolded President Buhari for the failure of the federal government to pay the 774,000 youths it recruited across 774 local government areas of the country under the Extended Special Public Works (ESPW).
According to the federal government as revealed by the Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo SAN, each of the 774,000 is to earn a monthly wage of N20,000 (before tax) for a duration of one year. The PDP decried that the beginning of the interventionist programme was being stalled by the inability of the government to pay the beneficiaries. The party, therefore, questioned the capacity of the Buhari administration to ensure the success of the scheme for the year schedule.
