Kano Pillars had last Sunday toppled Akwa United on the league table when they defeated Enyimba 2-1 at home and with the latter playing out a 2-2 draw away against Wikki Tourist.
Although Enyimba had taken an early lead against Kano Pillars through Victor Mbaoma, but Sai Masu Gida warriors fought back to secure the maximum points with two second half goals from Rabiu Ali and Ifeanyi Eze.
However, Kano Pillars were on Thursday beaten 2-0 away by Rivers United. A result that saw them relinquished the top spot to Akwa United after their remarkable victory at home against Heartland.
Meanwhile, Kano Pillars who are currently sitting second and two points behind Akwa United will hope to return as league leaders when they host the Promise Keepers at Sani Abacha Stadium on Sunday.
The battle between Kano Pillars and Akwa United will see the winner take all as three points for the former will see them go two points ahead of the latter and return to the top of the log while a win or a draw for Akwa United will see them retain their position. However, the Akwa Ibom boys will fancy a win more than a draw as that will help them extend and tighten their lead at the top.
The football fans are anxiously in wait to see how it will unfold come on Sunday.
