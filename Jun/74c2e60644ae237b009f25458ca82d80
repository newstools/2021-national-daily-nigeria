The Akwa Ibom State Government on Thursday ordered the closure of a secondary school in Uyo, following threats by some cultists to the Principal of the School, Mr. Michael Iwok to recall their suspended members back to school.
The cultists were said to have issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Iwok, and also placed some fetish objects such as fresh pepper, palm oil droplets, peeled cooked egg, palm front, a piece of red cloth, tied rope and ten naira notes at the entrance of the principal’s office.
Similar items and several inscriptions, believed to have been dropped by suspected cultists, were also seen at the entrance to Senior Secondary 3 classes.

Chairman, Akwa Ibom State Secondary Education Board (SSEB), Dr. Ekaette Ebong Okon announced the immediate closure of the school.
Trouble started when some students suspected to be cultists were recently suspended by the school authority.
Also aggrieved are some senior secondary 2 students who could not meet up with the school requirements to be promoted into senior secondary 3.
Investigations reveal that on several occasions these two sets of students are responsible for the mayhem in the school.
The Police Public Relations Officer, SP Odiko MacDon when contacted said the closure of the school over threats by suspected cultists has nothing to do with the police.
