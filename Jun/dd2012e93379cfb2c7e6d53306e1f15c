They were said to have begun mobilization of able-bodied men in the community for self-defence and can no longer sit back at the risk of being killed by the Fulani herdsmen.
The pan-Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho, had ordered the Fulani herdsmen and their kinsmen in the southwest to vacate Yoruba land. He has been moving from state to state in the southwest sensitizing the people on the agitation for self-determination of the Yoruba nation – the Oduduwa Republic.
