He said IPOB members are intent on spreading secessionist messages across the state.
He listed the areas they are currently holding secret meetings in the state to include Igbanke, Ubiaja, Iguelaba, Igueben, Okhiahe and Ologbo.
Jitoboh, who noted that Edo and Balyesa are the states currently enjoying relative peace in the country, however cautioned that they must not allow anybody to come in and scuttle it with secessionist messages.
He asked the people in the communities where the harbingers of secessionists are holding their secret meetings to report the same to the police for urgent attention, noting that it is better to nip them in the bud than allow it to grow into something else in the state.
