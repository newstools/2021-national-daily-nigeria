Mr Olusegun Aladenika, the FRSC, Ore Unit Commander in Ondo State, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Ore.
He said that drivers should realise that the roads would be slippery during the rainy season and as such maintain normal speed limits to avoid unnecessary crashes.
Aladenika also urged motorists to ensure their wipers, brakes, brake lights, headlamps and indicators were in order before putting them on the highways.
“The rainy season is here, so we are appealing to motorists to ensure they maintain normal speed limits because of slippery roads occasioned by rains in order to avoid unnecessary crashes.
“They should also ensure that their vehicles are maintained before they set out for any journey.
“Motorists must also avoid late night travels and make sure they set out early to arrive at their destinations because of security reasons,” Aladenika said.
The FRSC boss said that all traffic rules and regulations must be strictly complied with, stressing “FRSC personnel are on the highways to enforce the rules and check excesses of motorists.”
