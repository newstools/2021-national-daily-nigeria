A man shot a woman and then himself on the grounds of the district court of the northern German city of Celle, a police spokeswoman told dpa.
The circumstances surrounding the crime on Thursday are now being investigated, she said.
The spokeswoman could not say at first whether there was a relationship between the perpetrator and the victim.
It was also not yet clear whether the shooting had anything to do with an appointment at the court.
