The leadership of JUSUN commended the efforts of the National Judicial Council in making sure that the governors obey the Memorandum of Agreement, and the judgment on the financial autonomy of the judiciary.
The union also commended the Chief Justice of Nigeria, and the heads of courts for their patience and understanding throughout the period of the strike.
JUSUN had, on April 6, announce that it will embark on a nationwide strike in protest demanding amongst other things, financial autonomy for the judiciary in the light of Sections 81 and 121(3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and decisions of Federal High Courts to the effect that all funds due to the judiciary from the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall be paid directly to the Heads of the Courts concerned..
