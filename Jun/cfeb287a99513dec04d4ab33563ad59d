Following a leak of Justice Minister Abubakar Malami’s memo to President Muhammadu Buhari counselling him to declare martial law and suspend the 1999 Constitution as amended, Nigerians have been debating the pros and cons of the declaration.
Here are 5 things you need to know about the declaration
1.Martial law was first proclaimed on Jan 15, 1966, by Maj. Kaduna Nzeogwu, in coup de tat.
2.It has been declared ever since then anytime the military is overthrowing a civilian government in Nigeria.
3.Martial law gives unlimited authority to the commander-in-chief of the armed forces to deal with criminalities
4.Under such declaration, the president relies on Section 305 of the Constitution which says the president can declare a national emergency to curb criminalities.
5.But legal fireworks come in in the matter of suspending Chapter IV of the constitution which entrenches fundamental human rights of every Nigerian.
