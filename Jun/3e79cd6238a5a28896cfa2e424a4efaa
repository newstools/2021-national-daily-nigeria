The Federal High Court in Lagos has discharged and acquitted Senator Peter Nwaoboshi of the N322 million money laundering charge filed against him.
Also discharged were the lawmaker’s two firms – Golden Touch Construction Project Ltd and Suiming Electrical Ltd – on the same ground.
The case was filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
According to Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke, the EFCC failed to prove the elements of the offences for which Nwaoboshi was charged.
Nwaoboshi was re-arraigned on Friday, October 5, 2018, alongside two companies, Golden Touch Construction Project Limited and Suinming Electrical Limited, on a two-count charge bordering on conspiracy and money laundering to the tune of N322 million.
