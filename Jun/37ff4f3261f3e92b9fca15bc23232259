President Buhari expressed that the ruling APC “is becoming more popular because of its impressive performance record and commitment to good governance.”
President Buhari in a message delivered on his behalf by the Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, at the defection ceremony in Gusau, Zamfara State, on Tuesday, declared: “I am proud of your timely and wise decision to join the governing party and our doors are wide open to other politicians who believe in our vision to rebuild Nigeria.
“Your voluntary decision to join our party confirms the fact that our agenda for good governance is the only reason why Nigerians are getting attracted to the APC because the other alternative didn’t work.”
The President, therefore, urged APC Governors and elected lawmakers across the country “to continue to work harder to ensure our party maintains its popularity and retains power beyond 2023.”
He told all elected party officials: “your performance at all levels will impact significantly on the fortunes of the party;” stating that “party leaders should avoid complacency at all times in order to build the APC from strength to strength.”
