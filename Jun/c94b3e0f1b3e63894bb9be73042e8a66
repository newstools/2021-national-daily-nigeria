An amalgam of Biafra agitators has deployed the military wing of the group to monitor and enforce restriction of vessels from outside Nigeria from entering the Bakassi Peninsula.
The Chief Head of Operations of the Biafra Nations League (BNL) revealed that the militia loyalists of the League are already monitoring the territorial waters to ensure no foreign vessel enters the Peninsula.
He maintained that “all foreign vessels coming to Nigeria remained banned from entering through the Peninsula.” The Head of Operations released pictures of battle-ready BNL militia on duty.
