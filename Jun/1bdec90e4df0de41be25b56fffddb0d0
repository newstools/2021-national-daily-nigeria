“As I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand. We have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks there will be a difference.
“Because we told them if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve. And the government can’t control the public. If you allow hunger, the government is going to be in trouble and we don’t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. So we warn them sooner than later you’ll see the difference.”
