According to Amnesty International on their official Twitter handle, @AmnestyInternational on Tuesday evening, these people were killed amidst insecurity across the nation.
“From Saturday, June 5, 2021, to date, more Nigerians have been killed: —Kebbi State: Danko-Wasagu 88 killed —Oyo State: Igangan 11 killed —Benue State: Agatu 30 killed —Zamfara: Zurmi 30 killed,” the NGO tweeted.
This brings the total to 159 people killed due to the ravaging insecurity sweeping the country.
The northwest has particularly been in the grip of kidnappers, robbers, cattle rustlers, and bandits.
The government has been helpless in curbing the insecurity, despite promises the APC government made, and orders President Muhammadu Buhari has been issuing to security agents.
