The Ogun Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) has appealed to motorists to exercise patience and refrain from reckless driving at construction zones to minimise crashes.
TRACE divisional commander, Mowe-Ibafo axis, Mr Ojuoro Olusola, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday, in Ota, Ogun.
Olusola urged motorists to drive with caution by reducing speed to the minimum level because of the slippery tarred roads, especially during this rainy season to prevent avoidable accidents.
“We are appealing to motorists to shun speeding as the roads would be slippery during the rainy season.
“In addition, they need to exercise patience at diversionary areas where construction works are ongoing to avoid unnecessary mishaps,” he said.
Olusola stressed the need for motorists to ensure that the brakes of their cars, wipers, trafficators, headlamps and others were functional.
He further advised motorists to park their vehicles while traveling during heavy rainfall.
Olusola also admonished them against night travel because of poor visibility to avoid ramming into stationary vehicles to avoid loss of lives and property.
