The reception of PDP governor defecting to the APC has proved the bloodiest in the history of defection ceremony as bandits went on the rampage after the event.
Already, a Zamfara lawmaker Muhammed Ahmed shot dead, and his son and driver kidnapped when he ran into the bandits along the Shema-Funtiua Road in Katsina.
Kano Gov Abdulahi Ganduje was only lucky he didn’t go in his convoy after the ceremony. His entourage also ran into the bandits’ ambush, and exchange of gunshots ensued between his security details and the criminals on Tuesday.
Governor Ganduje joined Jigawa Governor Muhammadu Abubakar Badaru, back to Kano—because his convoy were shot on fuel.
In the gun battle, the ambulance in the convoy was riddled with bullets why a couple of police men also got wounded. The security agents however pushed back the bandits.
