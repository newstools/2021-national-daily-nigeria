Share this on WhatsAppHer husband left on a journey two years ago, with two children only for him to return to a home with no kids.
Blessing Agoro has sold her two daughters—for N300,000.
Her reason: she could not take care of them.
The 35-year-old housewife would later tell the  men of Ogun State Police Command, Redemption Camp, she sold the girls, age four and two, to a couple from Port Harcourt.
She was arrested following a report by her husband, Oluwaseyi Agoro.
The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi disclosed this in a statement on Sunday.
Oyeyemi said the husband reported that when  he couldn’t find his two daughters, and all  efforts to make his wife tell him the whereabouts of the children failed.
“Upon the report, the DPO Redeemed Camp division, CSP Alabi Akinjide, detailed his detectives to apprehend the suspect, who had already been with the camp’s code of conduct department.
“On interrogation, the suspect explained to the police that her husband left home for the past two years, and while he was away, she found it difficult to cater for the two children with her other two children she had for another man.
“She stated further that while she was contemplating on what to do, one Kolawole Imoleayo introduced her to a couple in Port Harcourt who was in need of children. She sold the two daughters to the couple at the rate of three hundred thousand naira (N300,000).
“Her confession led to the arrest of the said intermediary, Kolawole Imoleayo. They are both assisting the police in their investigation.”
Ogun CP Edward Ajogun, has ordered the transfer of the suspects to the anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation.
He directed that the children must be rescued and brought back to their parents.
