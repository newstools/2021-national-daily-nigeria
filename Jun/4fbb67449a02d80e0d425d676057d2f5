Some agitators who couldn’t wait for Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, to come in favor of a Yoruba nation jingoists have read his mind, and posted it on social media.
A WhatsApp post on the Yoruba state agitation, attributed to him was shared many times yesterday. Forcing the literature icon to issue a denial.
Titled ‘They are back’, the statement urged the public to ignore the post and utterances of people, who stole his identity, to pass messages on social media.
According to him, he does not participate in Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and other offerings of social media.
Any views he wants to express on any issue would be done through the print media.
The statement said, “Professor Wole Soyinka wishes to denounce the fake WhatsApp posting on the Yoruba state agitation being attributed to him.
“Once again, he requests the public to ignore the utterances of those contemptible interlopers, who lack the courage of their conviction and thus take to identity theft for the furtherance of their views. For a start, Wole Soyinka does not participate in Facebook, tweet, blog, WhatsApp or other offerings of the social media.
“Any views that he wishes to express on national and other issues routinely go through the print media.”
Followers of Sunday Adeyemo of the Ilana Omo Yoruba led by Prof Banji Akintoye have een outspoken in condemning Yoruba leaders apathetic to their secessionist bid.
Adeyemo, aka Igboho is equally fund of fawning on prominent Yoruba leaders and dropping their names as sympathisers to the agitation.
All the governors in the southwest and political leaders have disowned the agitators.
