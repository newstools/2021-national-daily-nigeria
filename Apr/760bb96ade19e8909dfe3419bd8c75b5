The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari came under serious attack recently when the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, berated him for the poor handling of the insecurity problems facing the country.
Speaking at the holy Convocation organized by the Victory Life Bible Church in Abeokuta, President of CAN, Rev. Samson Ayokunle described President Buhari as incompetent and religiously biased in the country.
Ayokunle, who spoke on the theme of the convocation, ‘The state of the nation: The way forward’, argued that the insecurity and other vices being witnessed in the country were as a result of negligence on the part of the Buhari administration.
Ayokunle, who also worried about the spate of insecurity and criminality in the country, lamented that criminals were being more professional than various security outfits in Nigeria.
He said about the President, “We put you there to secure the nation; we didn’t put you there to be complaining about bad leaders.
“The criminals are behaving more professionally than the regular law enforcement agents. You were complaining about past leaders; we knew that the past leaders didn’t do well and we approached you to make change.”
