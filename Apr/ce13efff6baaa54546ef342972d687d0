Youths in their thousands have taken over major roads in Ibadan, Oyo state capital, demanding for Oduduwa Repubics.
According to reports, the protests coordinated by a group “Ilana Omo Oodua”, clamoring for self –determination, is led by Professor Banji Akintoye, a former Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
The protest, which was supposed to start around 9.am on Saturday, could not start until 11.am due to heavy security presence at the entrance and around Mapo Hall.
The protesters having sensed heavy security presence later mobilized to the front of Mapo to begin the protest.
Some of those who spoke, noted that the Yoruba nation had suffered enough in Nigeria.
One of the leaders of the group, Bashorun Kunle Adesokan maintained that it was time for Yoruba races to have their own country.
He said, “Youuba have suffered enough. We are not in support of the 2023 elections. We are telling all politicians not to contest. They should not contest to waste their money.”
Publicity Secretary of the group, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye confirmed that the security agencies did not allow the protest to be held at Mapo Hall as earlier scheduled.
He said, “Dear Colleagues, the Police in Mapo, Ibadan said they are at the venue to prevent hoodlums from hijacking the rally for Yoruba Self-Determination, and not stopping it from holding.”
