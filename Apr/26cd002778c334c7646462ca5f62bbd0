There seems to be a division within the rank and file of the Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, over the 2023 presidential ambition of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former governor of Lagos state.
While some leaders of the group have expressed support for Tinubu, others are distancing themselves from such a support.
It would be recalled that Pa Reuben Fasoranti, elder statesman and former leader of group, declared that Tinubu has all what it takes to rule Nigeria when members of South West Agenda for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (SWAGA 23), paid him a courtesy visit in his country home in Akure.
According to the Afenifere leader, with Tinubu as president, all the prayers of Afenifere for Nigeria will be answered, particularly on the issue of restructuring and federalism.
However, on Wednesday, April 7, Afenifere denied endorsing any candidate in a statement by its Director of Communications, Sola Lawal, titled, ‘Afenifere denies endorsing presidential aspirant.’
Lawal stated that Afenifere is still mourning the demise of its Publicity Secretary, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, in whose honour the group suspended all engagements.
Lawal also pointed out that 96-year-old Pa Fasoranti had taken a “deserved rest when he formally handed over to Chief Ayo Adebanjo three weeks ago after leading the group for 12 years and so the former couldn’t have spoken for Afenifere during the SWAGA visit to his Akure home.”
“Afenifere has temporarily halted all activities in honour of Odumakin who is still lying in the morgue, cold and lonely. The Adeyeye foray into Afenifere space at this period of huge loss and intense mourning is disrespectful, insensitive and unwarranted,” Lawal added.
