Several stakeholders in the nigerian project have resorted to identifying the difference between the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) since 2015, and the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan 2010 to 2015.
An aide to the former President, Reno Omokiri, has taken to the social media to provide data on the difference in price of commodities and services which affect the standard of living of citizens in the country. The data provided by Omokiri tend to indicate that the standard of living of Nigerian citizens had declined significantly.
Omokiri highlighted that the Jonathan administration left office when a 50kg of rice cost N8,000, fuel sold at N87/litre, exchange rate was N199 to $1, a tin of Peak milk was sold at N80, a bottle of coca cola N60, etc.
Reno Omokiri had tweeted @renoomokri: “as the Naira approaches ₦500 to $1, let me remind Nigerians of how we left Nigeria on May 29, 2015: – 50kg bag of rice was ₦8000 – Fuel was ₦87 – $1 was ₦199 – Lagos-Abuja air fare was ₦10,000 – Coke was ₦60 – Peak milk was ₦80.”
He added: “banditry was nonexistence in the northwest; killer herdsmen were being arrested and tried; Boko Haram were being devasted, not rehabilitated…”
Omokiri, the asked: “don’t you miss Goodluck Jonathan?”
The comparison has continued to generate contentious debate by several other stakeholders.
