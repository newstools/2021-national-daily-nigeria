After the English football announced its social distancing from Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms, more sports bodies, personalities around the globe have joined in solidarity.
As of Friday, the English cricket and rugby clubs, and the British Lawn Tennis Association have joined in protesting the racist abuse of social media and the coldness of the owners in tackling the menace.
“FIFA supports the initiative from English football to call out discriminatory and other offensive abuse on social media,” world football’s governing body said in a statement. “This has no place in football or society more generally and we strongly condemn it.”
“We believe that authorities and social media companies should take real and effective steps to put an end to these abhorrent practices because it’s getting worse all the time and something needs to be done — and done quickly — to put a stop to it.
The social media silence will start today until late Monday evening.
There have been complaints of abuse and manipulation by the platform owners, and the US, where most of them originate, is also worried, and might take strict measures against them.
