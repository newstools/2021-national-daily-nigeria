A cyberfraud academy proprietor was nabbed in Abuja January, and its punishment is no more  than a pat on the wrist.
Farouk Olaniyan operated an institution training Yahoo Boys wannabes in art and science of online fraud in Mpape, Abuja, until January.
After intelligence on Olaniyan’s academy, the EFCC stormed the place and arrested the promoter.
In court, he pleaded guilty, and the EFCC counsel, Adeola Olanrewaju urged the court to convict and sentence him.
But the defence counsel said his client was a first-time offender and prayed the court to temper justice with mercy.
Justice Kekemeke then sentenced Olalekan to three-month imprisonment with an option of N200,000 fine.
