Mr Sylvester Alabi, Commissioner of Police, Bauchi state Command has directed Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) to sensitise parents on Sexual Gender based Violence (SGBV) in their various divisions in the state.
Alabi said this when two NGOs; Attah Sisters Helping Hands Foundation (ASHHF) and Federation of Muslim Women Association of Nigeria (FOMWAN) paid him a visit on Thursday in Bauchi.
He said he realised the high wave of rape cases in the state, hence the need to take proactive not reactive action.
The CP expressed concern over the high rate of sexual gender based violence in the state.
“With that I have directed all DPOs to embark on sensitisation to parents, because they have a role to play.
“I have asked them to make use of the wives of LGA chairmen and maternity centres where women gather,” Alabi said.
He noted that the sensitisation programme was on-going in LGAs and yielding results, adding that the crime rate was gradually reducing in the state.
The police boss urged the NGOs and other stakeholders to inform the police of any dubious attempt and help the police by sensitising the parents on SGBV.
He said his doors were always open because he shared the same vision and mission with the NGOs.
Earlier, Hajiya Aisha Ibrahim Amirah, chairperson, FOMWAN Bauchi State, said they were in the CP’s office to formally welcome him to the state and seek collaboration where necessary.
She intimated the police boss on the need to fight the scourge of sexual gender based violence and other social vices in the state.
On her part, Mrs Comfort Attah, the Executive Director of ASHH Foundation, explained that the two NGOs had also embarked on sensitisation of 20 local government areas on the evils of SGBV.
Attah appealed to the Commissioner of police to attend one of their monthly committee meetings on sexual gender based management in the state.
