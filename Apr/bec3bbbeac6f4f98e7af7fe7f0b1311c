German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer expressed the belief on Wednesday that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) would agree to synchronise troop withdrawal from Afghanistan with Washington.
On Tuesday, the U.S. presidential administration announced that the United States would complete the troop withdrawal by Sept. 11.
The date will mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, after which the administration of ex-U.S. leader George Bush started its operation against al-Qaeda terrorist organisation (banned in Russia).
“We have always said: we will deploy (troops) together and we will withdraw them together as well.
“I am a supporter of a coordinated troop pullout and I expect that we (NATO) will reach an agreement on this today.
“This means we will synchronize our plans with the U.S.,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told ARD broadcaster.
