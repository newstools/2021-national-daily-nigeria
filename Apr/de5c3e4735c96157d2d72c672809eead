The Nigerian presidency on Thursday intervened to save the National Sports Festival being hosted in Benin City, Edo State, from being ended suddenly due to lack of funds.
The Local Organising Committee (LOC) Edo2020 at an emergency meeting reviewed the Presidential intervention over financial crisis threatening the National Sports Festival. The meeting presided by the Chairman/Deputy Governor, Edo State, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu, resolved that the games should continue.
The LOC agreed that the Presidential intervention is a very strong and direct commitment which the committee members must all respect, honour and take seriously.
“We strongly believe and respect commitments from the Presidency. We take them by their words. It’s a strong message to us that they are strongly committed to redeeming their pledge to support us for the loses suffered arising from the three postponements of the games,” the LOC declared.
The LOC appreciated President Muhammadu Buhari, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo, the Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, and indeed the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, for his high level of commitment to work with the Federal Government for the success of the Festival, Edo2020.
The committee wished the athletes and officials from across the 35 States and the FCT a memorable stay in Edo as the games continue.
