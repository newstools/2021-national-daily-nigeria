The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday extended the sale of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for the Anambra State governorship election from the earlier date of  Wednesday, March 31, 2021 to Wednesday, April 7, 2021.
The party also extended the date for the submission of the forms to Saturday, April 10, 2021.
The PDP in a statement on Wednesday by the National Organizing Secretary, Col Austin Akobundu (rtd)., declared, “all aspirants, leaders of our party, critical stakeholders as well as our teeming supporters in Anambra are to take note and guided accordingly.”
The PDP appears to be having stronger aspirants for the governorship race than other political parties. However, Prof. Charles Soludo of the APGA has been a front line governorship aspirant in Anambra. Soludo was attacked on Wednesday by gunmen during a town hall meeting in the state. Three policemen were said to be killed in the attack.
