Chelsea FC of England on Wednesday defeated FC Porto of Portugal 2-0 in a quarter final first leg match in Spain. Mason Mount scored the first goal for Chelsea against FC Porto, the team that defeated Juventus of Italy where a world class footballer, Ronaldo plays. Chelsea was playing on away match to FC Porto.
Mount scored in the first half against Porto in the first leg match in Seville, Spain.
Porto had returned for the second half of the game with the enthusiasm of bouncing back. Unfortunately, the team’s aspiration was dampened by the second goal scored Ben Chilwell who took advantage of a error at the back to dribble pass the keeper to score a late second goal which brightened Chelsea’s chance of sailing into the last four.
The goals and victory count as away goals and away wins, though, both teams were scheduled to play on a neutral ground in the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. The teams are playing their second led game next week on the same venue but with reversal of home and away schedules.
In the second game, PSG of France had defeated German’s Bayern Munich 3-2 in an away match. Both teams will also be playing the second leg on Wednesday next week.
