The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Sunday said that infrastructure in terms of roads is critical to his administration, noting that road construction and maintenance alone takes 60% of the State’s capital expenditure every year.
Sanwo-Olu who disclosed this in an interview with Channels TV said the state has over 10,000 roads, and fixing them remains paramount to his administration.
“Infrastructure in terms of roads is critical to us, if you take Lagos West, right now we have just awarded the old Navy town road in Ojo and other notorious heavy traffic roads,” he said.
“Around Lagos East, we are doing similar projects at the same time, also at Lagos Central in Ikoyi, which are brand new roads with drainages everywhere. That’s what the citizen’s needs, we are also focusing on regional roads and also internal roads.
“Lagos has over 10,000 roads, it’s huge for us, it’s a work in progress but we need to be very strategic, we are looking at roads that can be used for commuting and connecting communities.
“We must continue fixing roads, it is always about 55-60% of our capital expenditure every year,” he added.
It would be recalled that the Lagos state government had announced that it would increase infrastructure spending in 2021 to 60% of its budget, in a bid to repair damages inflicted by hoodlums in October following the EndSARS protests.
Also, the National Bureau of Statistics recently revealed that Lagos State recorded the highest Internally Generated Revenue of N418.99 billion, accounting for 32.1% of the total; followed by Rivers State with N117.19 billion.
