The United States Capitol Police says it has arrested a suspect in connection with an attack on policers after a vehicle plowed into Capitol Police officers on Friday.
In a statement, the U.S. Capitol Police said it was responding to reports that “someone rammed a vehicle into two USCP officers. A suspect is in custody,” the USCP statement said. “Both officers are injured. All three have been transported to the hospital.”
Earlier, a message played over the loudspeakers inside the Capitol said that all buildings were being locked down “due to an external security threat” and staff members were told they could not enter or exit the buildings.
A photo taken by an Associated Press photographer showed officers surrounding a vehicle that appeared to have crashed into a barricade on the Capitol’s north side.
Tensions in Washington have remained high in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.
Republicans have spent weeks pressuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to remove protective fencing erected in the aftermath of the attack.
Both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives were not in session Friday.
