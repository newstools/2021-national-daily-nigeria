At least 55 people were killed and more than 40 injured as three villages were burnt during fighting in the central African country of Chad, a governor told dpa on Friday.
The clashes in the south-eastern region of Salamat erupted between different ethnic groups on Wednesday night.
The affected were the villages around the provincial capital of Am Timan, according to Salamat Governor, Abel Yamabaye Massira.
Dozens of injured people were being treated at hospital as of Thursday, he said.
The reason for the violence remained unclear on Friday.
Conflicts between population groups in the region often revolve around resources such as land and livestock as well as escalating revenge attacks or protracted ethnic tensions.
