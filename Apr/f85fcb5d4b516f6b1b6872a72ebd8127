The Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, had directed commanders on ground in Benue state to fish out and deal decisively with killers of 11 soldiers deployed to the state.
Recall that a stockpile of military hardware with about N28 million cash was carted away by marauding bandits who ambushed a select group of Nigerian troops on a reinforcement mission to quell pockets of communal clashes in Benue.
The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Yerima, in a statement on Thursday in Abuja confirmed the killing of one officer and 10 soldiers in the attack.
General Yerima said the troops were initially declared missing, which led to the deployment of a joint search and rescue team comprising army troops and Operation Whirl Stroke personnel.
He explained that the search and rescue team, unfortunately, found all the missing troops dead in Konshisha local government area.
According to him, while the slain troops’ bodies were evacuated immediately, efforts are ongoing to track down the attackers.
He said the Nigerian Army would remain resolute in ensuring stability in Benue and other parts of the country that are affected by criminal gangs’ activities.
“It may be recalled that Benue which was a hotbed of violent clashes has been enjoying relative peace following the successes achieved by the various security agencies that have been working tirelessly to safeguard law-abiding citizens and ensure they go about their legitimate business without fear of harassment by criminals.
“The Nigerian army appeals to the public to volunteer useful information that will lead to the arrest of the perpetrators of this dastardly act,” he said.
