Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has decorated Nobel laureate Prof Wole Soyinka as Super Marshal of Western Nigeria Security Network codenamed Amotekun corps in Ogun State.
This followed the inauguration of the corps on Thursday.
During the ceremony on Thursday in Abeokuta, the state capital, the governor also inaugurated patrol vehicles and motorcycles for operatives of the Amotekun corps in the state.
Retired commissioner of police David Akinremi was announced as commander of the corps.
The operatives are expected to be deployed to all the 20 LGAs of the state to curb kidnapping, herder-farmer crisis, and banditry.
In 2020, governors of the south-west states established the security outfit to tackle the rising cases of criminality in the region.
