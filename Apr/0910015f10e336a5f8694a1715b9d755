After their names and other details were published and Interpol notified by Nigeria’s prison authorities, inmates that escaped during the attacks on the Owerri Correctional Facility and the police custody I Imo are trooping back—voluntarily.
No fewer than 125 inmates have returned so far, out of the 1884 and 500 in the two separate attacks on April 5.
NCoS spokesperson, Francis Enobore, a Controller of Corrections, noted that some undisclosed international organisations were reaching out to the service to offer some form of assistance in tracking down the missing inmates.
“We have already reached out to the Interpol through the Nigeria Police Force. A lot of other international organisations are getting information from our website. Some organisations called to collect certain information from our website, we are working in synergy with them.
‘’Altogether, we have 125 inmates back in custody as at close of work yesterday (Friday). According to the information I got, most of them are returning by themselves. All their pictures and data have been circulated everywhere, so they know there is no hiding place for them.
‘’Some were brought back by their parents. We have also been reinforcing the message that instead of remaining a fugitive for life, it’s better they come back on their own.’’
The service further said the upgrade of its system enabled it to quickly collate the data and pictures of the inmates, a development Enobore said helped greatly with the manhunt for them, adding that their particulars had also been dispatched to their relations and communities.
