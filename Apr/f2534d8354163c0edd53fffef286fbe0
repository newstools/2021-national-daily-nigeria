When Communications and Digital Economy Minister Isa Pantami’s case—his past combustible comments on Jihadism—was raised on the floor of the lower chamber Wednesday, a little drama ensued.
The Senate screened Pantami when President Muhammadu Buhari nominated him as minister in 2019. His past then was no issue.
But Minority Leader Ndudi Elumelu, reacting to the trending stories about the minster’s sympathy for Taliban and AlQaeda, asked the house to consider his sack or resignation.
The house Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila however over-ruled him.
Gajabiamila said the matter Elumelu raised had nothing to do with the lawmaker’s privilege.
“Your point of order is noted,” Gbajabiamila said as hit the gavel.
The plenary then moved to other items on the agenda.
President Buhari has no reacted since the Pantami matter hit the headlines.
