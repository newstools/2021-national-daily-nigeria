Kaduna APC has introduced a cutting-edge technique for selecting LGA election aspirants seeking the party tickets: an exam.
More than one hundred aspirants in the coming LG election had to write an exam and sat for an oral interview invigilated by 17 professors, PhD holders, and lawyers on April 21.
He exercise took place at Stonehedge Hotel in Kaduna, and the candidates sat through while it lasted for hours.
The candidates wrote essays out of their bios, and Kaduna.
How much that knowledge could contribute to good local governance is question. But the exercise, at least, could prove their literacy level, and save the APC the embarrassment of putting forwards illiterates.
An aspirant, according to the Nation, said the exam was thorough, and that it made them produce their relevant documents for scrutiny—to avoid post-election disputes.
