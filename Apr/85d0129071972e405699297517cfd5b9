The Arab League (AL) on Thursday strongly condemned the forcible displacing of the families in Sheikh Jarrah, a predominantly Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
In a statement, the AL warned against the provocative calls by the Israeli settlers for gathering in the Old City to attack Muslims during their prayers in the holy month of Ramadan.
It called on the international community to put an end to the aggression against the Palestinian people and the city of Jerusalem and to stand firmly against the forcible displacement bids.
It also demanded the international institutions to enforce the international laws and ensure international protection for the Palestinian people.
