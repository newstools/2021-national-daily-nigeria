The Nigeria Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC) on Wednesday carried out an inspection of the aircraft and facilities of the Jordan Aviation Operation and Technical centre in preparation for the 2021 Easter pilgrimage in Jordan.
The Public Relations officer of NCPC, Mrs Mary Gana, made this known in a statement to newsmen on Wednesday.
The General Manager of Jordan Aviation, Mr Bassam Moshen, speaking during the inspection, said that the company had been in operation for over 20 years and had a track record of excellent customer services to meet the needs of the commission.
Moshen said that all the aircraft were in good condition as they had been certified and were manned by qualified Professionals who were committed to their responsibilities.
He assured that the airline was ready to meet any target or demands set by the commission as they had a rich history of delivering quality services across Europe, Far East and Central Africa.
He assured the commission of its readiness to ensure a smooth transportation of pilgrims to the Holy Land in safety and comfort.
A tour to inspect the aircraft and the Aviation centre was carried out by an eight-man delegation.
The Commission also plans to use the visit to ascertain the state of readiness for this year’s Easter Pilgrimage to Jordan.
