Nasarawa State House of Assembly has debunked speculations that it was plotting to impeach its Speaker, Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi.
Speaking on the floor of the House at the beginning of plenary yesterday in Lafia, the Majority Leader of the Assembly Tanko Tunga urged the people to disregard the news in its entirety, describing it as “fake news.”
Tunga was reacting to speculations going on in the state which has created tension, especially on social media, that some members of the assembly have consented to the plot to impeach the Speaker over allegations of wrongdoing.
According to him, the House is one of the most peaceful Assemblies in the country and has recorded the passage of many resolutions and bills that have a direct bearing on the lives of the people of the state.
“This House is 100 per cent in support of the leadership of the Speaker and cannot think of impeaching him at this material time,” he said.
The Majority Leader assured the Speaker of members’ continued readiness to give him all the necessary support to succeed. He enjoined him to sustain the spirit of his leadership.
The Minority Leader of the House Danladi Jatau described it as the big lie of the year.
