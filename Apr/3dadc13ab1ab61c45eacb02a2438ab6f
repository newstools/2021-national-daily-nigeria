The states in the southeast have been having relative internal peace before the incursion of the All Progressives Congress (APC) into Imo State, and the later carry over of Ebonyi State into the APC. The southeast has been remarkable for Biafra agitations but not for internal violence until recently despite military onslaught at different times.
Despite the agitations by successive Biafra group, from the MASSOB to the IPOB, the agitators had refrained from internal insurrection and arms struggle. Today, the story is different, particularly, in the two APC states in the southeast- Imo and Ebonyi – as well as Anambra State controlled by APGA. The agitations in the southeast have been converted to arms struggle and guerilla warfare, with sporadic attack on facilities of security agencies, including security personnel.
The latest was the explosion at the headquarters of the Police Command in Imo State, as well as the inferno at the prison’s facilities in the state on Sunday by unknown gunmen.
The pandemonium led to the release of over 2,000 inmates, in addition to the blown off of the state police command in Owerri.
