Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister has revealed that the 2023 presidential ambition of former governor of Lagos state, Bola Tinubu, would further strengthen the resolve of those calling for the creation of an Oduduwa Republic in the southwest.
The outspoken politician who gave the hint in a tweet on his official handle on Thursday, said this was because Tinubu is hated more by the Yoruba nationalists.
According to him, the agitation for Oduduwa Republic cannot be deterred or dissuaded by a Tinubu Presidency.
“As a matter of fact a Tinubu Presidency will only further strengthen the resolve of the separatists. This is because no-one is more hated by the Yoruba nationalists than Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
His tweets, however, have drawn the ire of some people on social media.
A twitter user by the name, Digital Slim Chik, said “I disagree with you totally. Most Southern Westerners love Tinubu.”
Another user, Bad Muffin said “Genuinely interested in how you come about with that figure…”
One Abiola attacked Fani-Kayode, saying “Which one you Dey self? Bridge Builder today, yòrùba nation tomorrow. Flip Flop Kayode.”
A twitter user, khamisAA(Gunners4life), asked Fani-Kayode: “How do you come with this figure sir? Or you just assume people in the SW hate BAT. No dey talk wetin you no sabi abeg.”
According to Barikazeez, “You’re definitely speaking the mind of the cancerous disease that Nigeria is suffering from since 1999 “PDP”. PDP is cancerous and has eaten Nigeria deep. Jagaban is the architect of their destruction and that’s why they hated him most. You will not survive it.”
Abdullahi Umar Musa told Fani-Kayode: “mind your business, if you have it. Jagaban pass your level.”
