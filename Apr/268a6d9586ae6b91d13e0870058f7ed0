The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has urged Christians to be law abiding, and live in peace with others as true followers of Jesus Christ.
Its President, Bishop Wale Oke, gave this admonition in his Easter message made available to journalists on Friday in Ibadan.
“Christians in the country must continue to be law abiding all the time.
“Violence will always produce negative effects, but as Christians we must learn to show love instead of hatred.
“It’s through love that we can conquer the world. Love is the most powerful tool for us to evangelise,” he said.
According to him, it is important for Christians to live in peace with others as true followers of Jesus Christ.
“The essence of Easter celebration will be meaningful, if we truly love one another.
“Our Lord Jesus Christ died and resurrected for you and I to gain eternity.
“All perpetrators of evil in our country should repent before it is too late. Jesus does not want any sinner to perish in their sins.
Oke, who expressed worries over the spate of kidnappings and wanton killings in the country, urged the Federal Government to take decisive action.
“It has become imperative for the government to direct its arsenal toward stemming the increasing cases of killings, raping, kidnappings and insurgency, among others in the country.
“The Federal Government should evolve a security mechanism that will further ensure the protection of lives and property of Nigerians, particularly Christians in the northern part of the country,” he said.
