Denmark is completely halting the use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, Danish Health Administration head, Soren Brostrom, said.
Brostrom Said at a press conference in Copenhagen on Wednesday that the vaccination campaign will continue without the shot from the British-Swedish company.
Denmark had temporarily suspended vaccinations with the AstraZeneca shot on March 11.
This is as a precautionary measure and the country has not resumed them since then, even to a limited extent as other countries have done.
The reasons for the halt were isolated severe cases of blood clots and suspected deaths in people who had previously been vaccinated against COVID-19 with the AstraZeneca shot.
