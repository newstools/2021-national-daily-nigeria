The militant arm of the proscribed IPOB—the Eastern Security Network—was responsible for the bombing and jailbreak at the Imo Correctional Facility on Monday.
Inspector-General of Police Mohammed Adamu said this in a press statement.
IPOB, however, has denied attacking the prison where scores of vehicles were burnt and cell doors flung open for no fewer than 1500 prisoners.
The attackers also freed the suspects in almost all the cells at the State Criminal Investigation Department of the command.
“Preliminary investigations have revealed that the attackers, who came in their numbers with sophisticated weapons such as General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), Sub-Machine Guns (SMGs), AK49 rifles, Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), are members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)/Eastern Security Network (ESN),” Adamu said in a statement signed by Force PRO Frank Mba..
“The attempt by the attackers to gain access to the Police armoury at the Headquarters was totally and appropriately resisted by Police operatives on duty who repelled the attackers and prevented them from breaking-in and looting the armoury.
“The armoury is thus intact! Similarly, the police suffered no human casualty, apart from a police Constable who sustained a minor bullet wound on his shoulder,” the statement read.
The IGP also directed the Commissioner of Police in the state and a new Special Investigation Team “to carry out holistic investigations into the incident with a view to fishing-out the perpetrators and bringing them to justice”.
The police boss also ordered the immediate deployment of additional units of Police Mobile Force and other Police Tactical Squads to the state to strengthen security in the state and prevent further attacks on security formations or any other critical national infrastructure in the state.
