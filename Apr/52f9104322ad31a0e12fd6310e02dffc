Ondo State Government has petitioned the Nigerian police over the refusal by immediate past Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi to return official vehicles.
The vehicles are: Land Cruiser SUV, New Toyota Hilux, New Toyota Hilux and Toyota Hilux.
The Ondo Government said Agboola were unlawfully in possession of the vehicles.
Senior Special Assistant to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Special Duties and Strategy, Dr. Doyin Odebowale, who signed the petition, said he has been mandated to recover all government properties still in the possession of former political office holders in the state, especially those who served in the immediate past administration.
Dr. Odebowale said all entreaties to Agboola to return the four vehicles for use of the incumbent Deputy Governor have been rebuffed.
According to the petition: “We lodge this complaint believing that you will use your good offices to look into this brazen act of conversion, and this is being charitable.
“Any person who keeps/detains the property of another with the intent to deprive the owner, permanently, of the usufruct right conferred therefrom, has committed an offence known in law as STEALING.
“This office undertakes to assist the Command with regard to the necessary logistics to recover the converted properties.”
Agboola had earlier said he was yet to receive any letter asking him to return the vehicles.
