The Kano State Shariah Commission has urged perishable commodity sellers in Yankaba and other markets not to hike their prices during the Ramadan.
Chairman of the commission, Bashir  Tijjani, said this during a sensitisation visit to perishable commodity  markets at Yankaba, Nasarawa Local Government in Kano.
According to Tijjani, the commission is  conducting sensitisation visits to four major markets in the state to let sellers know the huge benefits attached to selling at cheaper prices during the Ramadan.
Tijani said that there are usually great blessings for those who sell their goods at cheaper prices during the Ramadan fasting.
Chairman of the perishable commodity sellers in Yankaba Market, Alhaji Danladi Arko, thanked the commission for enlightening his fellow sellers.
He promised that his members would reduce the prices of their commodities.
“Due to the economic challenges we are facing now, perishable items should be sold at affordable prices all the time and not only during Ramadan to enable people to buy,” Arko said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the commission members visited Yan’lemo, Yankaba Market, Galadima Road and Dawanau Markets.
