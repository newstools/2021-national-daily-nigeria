APC Gov. Aminu Masari has highlighted the difference between President Muhammadu Buhari and one past president in terms of their ability to tolerate nonsense.
He didn’t name the president, though.
The difference, Masari said, has added to Buhari’s success—and that of the ruling APC.
“And you know we had a president, even though a civilian president, who couldn’t take all this rubbish that some people are doing. But Buhari is taking everything,” the Katsina governor said during an interview on the TVC.
Of the APC, he said the pasty has not failed in delivering their campaign promises to Nigerians.
According to him, anybody saying the rating of a particular political party has gone down can only confirm that during elections.
“And from what we have seen in the (APC) revalidation of new members, I think you are getting it wrong.
“I think APC is still the strongest, most reliable and dependable party in Nigeria today.”
The PDP and many Nigerians have dismissed the president and the APC as failures, owing to growing insecurity and economic frustration.
