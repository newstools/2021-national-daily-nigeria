The highly anticipated champions league match between Chelsea and Porto finally comes up later today and everyone is obviously curious as to how Chelsea respond after their loss against Westbrom in the EPL.

Tuchel finally came up with the team list and there seems to be a little bit if surprise as homegrown youngster Billy Gilmour did not make the team list.


Gilmour has recently found life under Tuchel really difficult and chances have been really hard for him to get. This may be due to the fact that Tuchel currently plays with a two-man midfield with Jorginho, Kovacic and Kante all ahead of him in the pecking order. This means limited slots compared to Lampard’s three-man midfield which accommodates three midfielders at a time.

See full list below.

Kepa Arrizabalaga
Edouard Mendy
Toni Rudiger
Marcos Alonso
Andreas Christensen
Jorginho
Thiago Silva
N’golo Kante
Tammy Abraham
Christian Pulisic
Timo Werner
Willy Caballero
Kurt Zouma
Mateo Kovacic
Olivier Giroud
Mason Mount
Callum Hudson-Odoi
Ben Chiwell
Hakim Ziyech
Reece James
Cesar Azpilicueta
Kai Havertz
Emerson Palmieri

Gilmour had a loan move in mind during the January transfer window so he could be in shape ahead of the upcoming Euros but that was the same time Tuchel just got the Chelsea job and he was so keen to see his game closely before making a loan decision or not.

With Gilmour not getting considered in games like this, he could be ready to force a loan move in the summer.
