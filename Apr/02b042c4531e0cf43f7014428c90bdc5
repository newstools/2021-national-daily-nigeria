Condolences have continued to trail the sudden demise of Publicity Secretary of Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin who died on Saturday at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH, after a brief illness.
President Muhammadu Buhari in a tribute signed by media adviser, Femi Adesina, described Odumakin as dutiful, and a person of conviction.
He expressed sorrow over his demise, when Odumakin had a lot more to contribute to society and the nation at large.
President Buhari prayed God to grant repose to the soul of the departed activist, and comfort all those who mourn him.
Also, former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode in his own message said he was deeply saddened by the death of Odumakin.
Reacting to his death, Fani-Kayode said “I am deeply saddened that we have lost Comrade Yinka Odumakin, one of our brightest and best. He was a great warrior who feared nothing and who stood for truth and justice, right to the end. The South West and indeed Nigeria has lost one of its greatest sons and brightest stars.
“Those of us who had the honour of being called your brother and who stood by you shoulder to shoulder through the most trying times for our people and the bitterest battles for the emancipation of our nation shall miss you dearly.”
