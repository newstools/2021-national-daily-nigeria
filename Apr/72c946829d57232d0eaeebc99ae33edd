Three soldiers died and 171 other missing after Boko Haram insurgents launched a major attack on the base of the special forces of the 27 Task Force Brigade, at Ngomari in Buni Yadi and Kumuya in the Buni Gari area of Yobe.
The camp was razed and military equipment destroyed in the attack.
“The terrorists attacked us on Friday morning. They attacked the military base and burnt it down. Three soldiers were killed, one injured, while about 171 are missing. The base is deserted but we have called in for reinforcements,” a military source was quoted by Sahara Reporers.
“One Camel MRAP was burnt, one 105MMPH Artillery gun burnt, one Conqueror and one T72 tank were also burnt. The terrorists also set the camp ablaze,” another source revealed.
Local informants and sympathisers gave the terrorists information that led to the surprise attack.
The insurgents withdrew when reinforcements from the Nigerian troops came to the base.
