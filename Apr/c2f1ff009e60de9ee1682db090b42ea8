Former Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State, on Saturday decried that people nominated as Boko Haram negotiators are now governing Nigeria.  The former Ekiti governor lamented that the security situation in the country is sufficient for “President Muhammadu Buhari and his men to wear sackcloth and cover themselves with ashes, they are seen making merry as if nothing has happened.”
Fayose, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Lere Olayinka, noted that the video leakage of the past extremism and religious fanaticism stance of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, exposed the hypocrisy and complicity of the Nigerian government in the insecurity crisis in the country. He bemoaned that over 300 Nigerians have been killed across the country in the past three days, while several others in the captivity of kidnappers and bandits.
The former Ekiti governor declared: “It is saddening and worrisome that spokesmen of the president were the ones going from one media house to another to defend someone who openly supported terrorists.” He decried that people who were at one time or the other nominated as Boko Haram negotiator are now governing the country.
Fayose declared: “It is funny that today, if those running the affairs of the country, are telling now us that armed bandits must be seen as innocent until proven guilty; they will be saying offence of forgery is more grievous than open declaration of support for terrorists.
“Because of their inability to take decisive actions against these terrorists that they appear to have sympathy for, Nigeria is no longer safe for anyone to live in.
“Our roads have been taken over by terrorists while Nigerians, including traditional rulers are now being abducted right inside their bedrooms.”
Fayose cautioned Nigerians to be cautious of traveling to avoid being victims of kidnappers and bandits.
