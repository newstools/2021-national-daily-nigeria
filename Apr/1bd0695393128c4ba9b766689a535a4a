The Forum of All Progressives Congress (APC) State Chairmen has urged the party’s leadership to expand the current membership revalidation and registration exercise throughout the world.
They made the announcement at a news conference on Thursday in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, following a closed-door meeting.
Ali Buka-Dalori, the forum’s chairman, clarified that the exercise had to be extended in order for more people to join the APC.
He said that the increased participation of Nigerians and the party’s strength in recent months indicated that more Nigerians were willing to join the party.
“In the interest of the party and all intending members of the party across the country, we, the state chairmen of the APC, refer to the party’s leadership and the CECPC to consider and carry out a further extension of the exercise.
“As a result, we are proposing that the exercise be extended to enable us to bring all willing people in our different states into the fold,” he said.
The logistics bottleneck and difficulty of the registration materials delivery process, according to Buka-Dalori, the APC Chairman in Borno.
He bemoaned the fact that a number of states had only recently obtained the materials needed to begin the second phase of the registration exercise and thus were unable to meet the revised registration timetable.
The forum chairman thanked the party’s leadership for deciding to hold the exercise, calling it a positive step.
“Immediately after the exercise began, we all saw the need for an extension to accommodate the second stage of the exercise, in light of the large turnout of Nigerians to affiliate with the party that was not properly planned for,” he said.
“After assessing the situation and arranging for the required materials to get everyone into the fold of the group, the need for further extension has logically arisen.”
