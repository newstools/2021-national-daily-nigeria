National President of the Nigeria Youth Union (NYU) Chinonso Obasi was yesterday invited by the Department of State Security Services (DSS), alongside other youth leaders over plan to disrupt official activities at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.
Obasi confirmed the invitation by the security agency, saying he was expected to be at DSS headquarters yesterday morning in honour of the invitation.
The secret police wants the youth leaders to explain why they want to shut down the airport with a protest.
Youth groups, comprising of Nigeria Youth Union (NYU), National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), National Association of Polytechnic Students (NAPS), National Association of Colleges of Education Students (NACES), Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), Northern Youths Initiative for Peace and Good Governance, had planned to disrupt peaceful activities at the airport yesterday to raise global awareness on the deplorable state of Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) in Nigeria.
The protest was aborted because of the DSS invitation of leaders of the planned protest.
Organisers of the protest told reporters that the plan to shut down the airport was because of the lukewarm attitude being shown by relevant authorities, particularly the leadership of Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) and Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) to their demand for better and efficient PHCs in Nigeria.
