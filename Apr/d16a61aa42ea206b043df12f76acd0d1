The Nigerian army has reassured residents of Damasak, and adjoining communities in Borno state which recently came under attack by Boko Haram terrorists, to remain calm as mop operations by the troops are ongoing to flush out the remnant of the terrorists who attacked a section of the town.
The insurgents who struck on Wednesday came with machine guns and a fleet of trucks.
The attack left hundreds of residents displaced as many took to the bushes for safety while some fled to neighbouring Niger Republic.
It was learnt that the terrorist group had attacked like six times now, and their plan is to take over the area, and since they couldn’t get into Damasak, they started attacking nearby villages like Gashigar, about 15 kilometres away.
In a statement by the Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, the Army debunked reports in a section of the media that Boko Haram terrorists have overran and are in control of Damasak town.
He assured residents of the town that the Army is in total control of the areas, “As we speak, troops are in total control of the general area and as can be seen in the attached video, the Commander of 5 Brigade, Brig Gen SS Tilawan, is driving round the town earlier this afternoon to assess the general situation following the cowardly attack by the terrorists who sneaked in from the northern flank yesterday in active collaboration of some local informants.
“The Nigerian Army wishes to assure residents of Damasak and adjoining communities to remain calm as mop operations by the troops are ongoing to flush out the remnant of the terrorists who attacked a section of the town.
