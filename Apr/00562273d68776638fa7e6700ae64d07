After surgical intervention to correct the bi-gender status of seven citizens of Kano, the state government has resolved to set up a hermaphrodite centre.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje’s spokesman, Abba Anwar, in a statement disclosed that the project would be executed in partnership with the TETFund Centre of Excellence of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto (UDUS).
Anwar said this while visiting the patients from UDUS.
The seven people were received at a special session of the State Executive Council.
Hermaphrodites have both male and female sexual organs, and they form the I –INTERSEX–in the LGBTI communities in liberal countries.
Researchers say there is now growing opposition to non-essential “cosmetic” surgeries, designed to mould ambiguous genitalia into a “binary” male or female appearance
According to Anwar, the state government, the governor’s concern is always the health and happiness of our people,” Anwar quoted the state governor.
“Kano state government was worried when we got information that there was one person with that intersex problem. We also learned that the person needed assistance for a surgical operation.
“We quickly intervened and took the patient to Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto. We then ordered a search for other similar cases in the state.
“We got six other cases, whom we also sent to UDUS, Centre of Excellence. Alhamdulillah all of them were successfully operated,” he said.
