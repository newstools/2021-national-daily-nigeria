The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) has confirmed that elections into the offices of Chairman, Vice Chairman and Councillors in the 20 Local Government Councils and 37 LCDAs in the State will hold  in July 2021.

LASIEC in a recent release signed by its Chairman, Hon. Justice Ayotunde Phillips (rtd), put paid to insinuations that a caretaker committee instead of a duly elected Council will be in charge at the local governments in Lagos.

The Public Relations Officer Mr. Tope Ojo who affirmed the stance of LASIEC on the proposed election in a telephone chat with National Daily, notes that the election will hold as scheduled.

The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) the body  charged with the statutory responsibility of electoral management and administration is committed to conducting a free, fair, credible and inclusive election.
The Statutory Notice shall be published very soon.

Pundits have however, raised concern about the fact that the LASIEC Chairman’s tenure if not extended comes to a halt by May 2021 and moves are in top gear by the state Governor Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu to get a replacement.
