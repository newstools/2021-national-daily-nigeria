Former Manchester United footballer Ryan Giggs has denied  the charge he was violent and engaged in behaviour towards his ex-girlfriend including isolation, belittling, humiliation, harassment, degradation and abuse.
A court heard on Wednesday.
Giggs, 47, also entered a not guilty plea of actual bodily harm to PR executive Kate Greville, 36, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester on November 1  2020.
He has also been charged with the common assault of Emma Greville, understood to be Ms Greville’s younger sister, during the same alleged incident.
The charge of controlling and coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship alleges the abuse lasted almost three years, between December 2017 and November 2020.
Giggs is nominally Wales  manager but has stood down for the last games and won’t coach at Euro 2020 in summer due to the charges.
The former player appeared in the dock at Manchester Magistrates’ Court for his first court appearance as the three charges against him were read out and he entered his not guilty pleas.
Giggs, who spoke only to confirm his name, address and enter his not guilty pleas, has been bailed to appear at Manchester Crown Court on May 26.
His conditions of bail are that he must not contact Kate or Emma Greville or go to any address where they are.
The hearing, lasting 13 minutes, dealt with procedural matters as the case was sent to the crown court for a further hearing.
