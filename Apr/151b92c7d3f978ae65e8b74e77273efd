Following a calming of the situation in the Gaza Strip, Israel had reopened the fishing zone off the Palestinian Territory.
After security consultations, it was decided to re-establish the zone at 15 nautical miles (about 28 kilometres), the responsible authority COGAT announced on Thursday.
After continuous rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip, the fishing zone in the Mediterranean Sea had been closed on Monday until further notice.
Israelâ€™s air force had also attacked facilities of Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, in response to the new shelling of its border towns.
A condition for a further return to routine was an observance of calm, the COGAT statement said
In August 2020, the Islamist Hamas announced a ceasefire with Israel after mediation by Qatar, but there were repeated violations.
Israel had tightened a blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2007, which is now supported by Egypt.
Both countries justify the measure with security considerations.
Hamas is classified as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the U.S. and the EU.
Fishing in the Gaza Strip is considered an important source of food and an economic growth engine for the population.
About 2 million people live in very poor conditions in the coastal area, and the number of coronavirus infections is currently also very high there.
