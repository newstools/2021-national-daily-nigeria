The Emir of Keffi, Dr Shehu Chindo-Yamusa, has cautioned Islamic preachers against provocative sermons capable of inciting public disturbances during and after the Ramadan fasting.
Chindo-Yamusa made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lafia on Wednesday.
He said that the clerics should always preach the message of peace to their followers and Nigerians at large.
“Religious preaching during this period should be targeted at maintaining harmonious relationships among the people and nothing should be done to divide the people,” he added.
The Emir urged Muslims to take advantage of the Ramadan fast to offer special prayers for leaders and for the peace, progress and development of the country.
He said that the fasting period was a time for sober reflection and an opportunity to move closer to God and seek His face in supplication and prayers.
The traditional ruler added that the present situation of the country has made it more imperative for Nigerians to fast and pray for unity and peace to reign.
He noted that fasting was not only for abstinence from food, drink and worldly pleasures, but a time to seek Allah’s power through prayers.
Chindo-Yamusa urged his subjects to actively participate in the daily preaching sessions, and restated his commitment to the growth of the community, the state and Nigeria in general.
The Emir further urged his subjects and Nigerians to continue to live in peace and tolerate one another irrespective of their differences.
He advised Muslims to avoid anything that would deny  them Allah’s reward, and always abide by the teachings and tenets of Islam.
Chindo-Yamusa urged well-meaning Nigerians to assist the less privileged in order to ensure harmony in the society.
