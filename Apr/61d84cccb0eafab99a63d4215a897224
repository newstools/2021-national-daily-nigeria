Iraqi President Barham Salih and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday called for the easing of tensions in the region.
During a phone call, the two leaders exchanged congratulations on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan and discussed ways to develop bilateral relations at various levels, according to a statement by the Presidency.
“The two presidents stressed the importance of reducing tensions in the region through a commitment to dialogue and meetings to resolve outstanding issues and meet various challenges,” the statement said.
The statement added that they also emphasised the need to enhance cooperation in confronting the coronavirus pandemic to limit its health and economic repercussions in the region.
The phone call came amid Iraq’s fear of the repercussions of escalating tensions in the region, as Iran vowed retaliation for an alleged Israeli cyberattack that caused a blackout at the Natanz enrichment facility in central Iran on Sunday morning.
The phone call is also coming amid the lingering stalemate between the United States and Iran over reviving the 2015 nuclear deal.
