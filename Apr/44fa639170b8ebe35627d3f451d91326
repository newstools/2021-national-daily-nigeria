Tomi Falase, Chairman of Lagos State Squash Association (LSSA), says their players’ performance at the just-concluded National Sports Festival (NSF) in Benin will motivate the association to groom more talents.
Falase told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Lagos that some Lagos State players’ departure has shown the crucial need to groom young players in the sport.
NAN reports that Team Lagos’ squash representatives won two bronze medals in the men’s singles and men’s doubles, in spite of losing top players shortly before the festival.
”We are excited at the prospect that our players have what it takes to compete and win among their peers. They didn’t cave in after seeing that other states came with top rated players.
”Their experience at the festival will further encourage us to develop our players at the grassroots. It is evident with the enormous talents we have in Lagos. We just have to focus on grooming them.
”The board has a focus, which is developing squash at the grassroots. We are committed to it and we are positive that it will yield the much desired result,’’ Falase said.
Wasiu Bello, Head Coach of LSSA, who was of the same opinion, added that  grooming players, takes dedication.
He  told NAN that with the dedication of the squash board, he was positive of future results.
”If we do it then, we can do it again. I trained some of the top players this country has today and by the grace of God, the zeal is still there.
”With efforts from all stakeholders in Lagos, it is achievable and come the next festival, we will perform better,’’ the coach said.
NAN reports that Lagos finished fifth on the medals table with 32 gold, 40 silver and 54 bronze at the 20th edition of the NSF tagged “Edo 2020”.
