Kano government has sent out an alert as citizens continue to consume different kinds of drink with lethal consequences in Ramadan.
No fewer than 10 persons have been confirmed dead, while 50 others are undergoing kidney related treatments after consuming those brands of drinks juiced up with hydroxylamine.
Authorities say the chemical is used by terrorists, although Kano hasn’t experienced much of Boko Haram terror lately.
Commissioner for Health, Dr Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyawa, in a video online now revealed that 400 others are on admissions at the hospitals.
” As you are aware, the Ministry of Health had in the recent past announced the outbreak of a strange disease traceable to the consumption of substandard juices,” said Tsanyawa.
“The consumption of this fake and substandard product has telling effects on the kidney, and vital organs of the body”.
According to him, there is a possibility for high patronage of juices as they fast in this hot season.
The National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control arrested some of the producers of similar drinks that killed some people in the state weeks ago.
NAFDAC noted last week that the chemical added to the killer flavoured drink that led to the death contained ‘Hydroxylamine,’ used for terrorism.
The agency said all further investigations have continued.
