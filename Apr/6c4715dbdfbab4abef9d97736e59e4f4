The Gymnastics Federation of Nigeria has hailed Edo state government for providing standard gymnastics facilities at the ongoing National Sports Festival in Benin.
Abba Mohammed-Inuwa, vice president of the Federation told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday at the Samuel Ogbemudia stadium that the federation was considering the state as host for future championships.
“I will like to express our appreciation to the government and people of Edo state for providing this state-of-the-art equipment.
“These equipment are very sophisticated and I am very sure that it is the first of its kind in West Africa as a whole.
“Yesterday (Sunday), we were here with the Deputy Governor (Philp Shaibu) for more than an hour and we informed him of our plans to make use of these facilities as a national camp, where we will be camping our athletes.
“And we are even soliciting for the cooperation and support of Edo state government so that we can host championships, nationally and internationally in Edo state.
“This is the only way we can have athletes that are fit and trained in Nigeria that can represent this country in future events.
“He has given us his words that Edo state is going to collaborate with the federation to ensure that these facilities are being put to use,’’ he said.
NAN reports that the gymnastics event which is still ongoing at the festival is expected to end on Tuesday.
