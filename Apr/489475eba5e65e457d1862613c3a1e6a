The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has denied any involvement with the attack on Imo State police headquarters and the Correctional Centre in Owerri on Monday.
Recall that the Inspector-General of Police Mohammed Adamu, had claimed that members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) masterminded the attack on Imo State Police Command.
He also blamed the group for the attack on the Headquarters of the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS) in Owerri on Monday.
IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, in a statement released today, said the gunmen responsible for the attack “are not IPOB or ESN security outfit.”
He insisted that ESN and IPOB are focused on chasing Fulani herdsmen away from their forests.
“The Nigeria Government and her compromised media outfits should stop linking IPOB and ESN to the multiple attacks going on in Nigeria now.
“IPOB was formed on the principle of peace and we are still in it. Unknown gunmen are different people which we don’t know them and they are not IPOB or ESN security outfit.”
The gunmen had stormed the correctional centre on Monday morning, setting the prison on fire and freed hundreds of inmates.
