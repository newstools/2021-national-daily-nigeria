Following the recent raid and arrest of 400 Boko Haram financiers in Kano, Lagos, and Abuja, and four other states, there has been an unease within Aso Rock cabal on the manner of the execution of the operation.
President Muhammadu Buhari approved of it in 2020 when the investigation began, but AGF/Justice Minister Abubakar Malami seems ruffled by the arrest and announcement of the suspects.
He has his reason, though.
According to Sahara Reporters, sources ithin the justice ministry said Malami didn’t like he announcement, more so that he did approve of it.
Malami is one of the footmen of the Aso Rock cabal, a coterie of Buhari’s family members and unelected allies micromanaging the president.
Malami is now angry with the task force, according o te source, because he had wanted to squeeze some favour from them by keeping the matter dark from the public.
The suspects are mainly bureau de change operators in Nigeria black forex markets in Lagos, Kano, Sokoto, Borno, Abuja, Adamawa, Kaduna, and Zamfara.
This is not the first time a bunch suspects linked to Boko Haram will be busted. Those arrested before usually weaseled out thanks to the jurisprudence of Nigeria’s foremost law officer who usually pleaded insufficient evidence.
It was the UAE government that succeeded in convicting and sentencing six Nigerians for financing the terrorist organization from Dubai in 2020.
At least N300bn has been confirmed wired to fund the terrorists so far.
