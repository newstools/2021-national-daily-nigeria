The Nigeria Center for Disease Control, NCDC, has admitted failures of the system over travelers’ inability to obtain QR Codes and COVID-19 test results.
Recall that passengers have expressed frustration over their inability to access the portal, cost of the test on arrival and other challenges.
Director-General, NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, while addressing the issue during an interview with newsmen on Thursday in Abuja said the agency experienced a system failure on April 20.
He also noted that the technical failure was resolved after about 12 hours
“On April 20, the agency experienced a system failure by one of the partner organizations supporting the management of the COVID-19 travel portal which led to an unforeseen downtime.
“We accept full responsibility for this event, which led to inconvenience for several travellers to Nigeria.
“We have learnt from this occurrence and continue to restructure our systems to avoid future events like this and serve Nigerians better. Our commitment remains to protect the health of Nigerians, by reducing the risk of spread of the virus,” he said.
He assured that the agency would continue to strengthen this process to make it seamless for all travellers.
