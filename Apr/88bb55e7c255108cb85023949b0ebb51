Posters of a former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki for the 2023 presidential contest have begun to flood strategic locations in the Federal Capital city, Abuja.
The colourful posters bearing Saraki’s bold photograph,proclaims “Reset Nigeria 2023”, “vote Saraki for president” slogan.
The posters are embossed with the logo and signature colours of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Saraki, through his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyonu, however, disowned the posters, saying he neither printed the posters nor assigned anyone to do so on his behalf.
In a telephone chat with our correspondent on Tuesday, Olaniyonu said: “We know nothing about the posters you are talking about. Except of course, you (our correspondent) printed them.
“When it is time for Dr Saraki to print posters, he will not do so in secret. We will not hide to print posters so we should be the one to ask you for the identities of those behind the printers”
