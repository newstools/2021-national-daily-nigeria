Despite being the most populous country in Africa and the largest economy on the continent, Nigeria has once again been by-passed, this time by social media giant, Twitter for Ghana.
Twitter announced on Monday, April 12, that it has opened new operations in Africa, where it has established a foothold in Ghana as its headquarters in Africa and is now hiring staff for its office.
Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey broke the news with one liner: “Twitter is now present on the continent”, with the flag of Ghana as illustration.
In a further statement today, the social media platform said it is looking for specialists to join several teams including product, design, engineering, marketing and communications.
“Full details on current job openings can be found on the Twitter Careers site”, the company said, in the statement by Kayvon Beykpour and Uche Adegbite.
Beykpour is the Product Lead, Twitter and Co-Founder, Periscope, while Uche is the Director, Product Management, Global Markets.
President Nana Akufo-Addo was excited by the news as he wrote on Twitter:
“The choice of Ghana as HQ for Twitter’s Africa operations is EXCELLENT news. Gov’t and Ghanaians welcome this announcement and the confidence reposed in our country.
“As I indicated to @Jack in our virtual meeting of 7th April 2021, this is the start of a beautiful partnership between Twitter and Ghana, which is critical for the dev’t of Ghana’s hugely important tech sector.
