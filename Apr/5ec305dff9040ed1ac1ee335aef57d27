Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has stated that the federal government’s N-Power and the TraderMoni micro-credit programmes cannot solve the many problems bedeviling Nigerians.
Obasa who stated this in a tweet titled ‘Matter of urgent public importance,’ said government policies should be given a human face in order to achieve the much desired results on Nigerians.
According to him, the hardship Nigerians, especially the youths are going through is unbearable, noting that dolling out N10,000 N-Power or Trader money cannot empower anybody. “We must do more persuasive things to encourage our people.”
Obasa’s statement came on the heels of the recent rising crime rate in Lagos and the worsening insecurity in the country.
Advising Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Mr Obasa said, “We should have CCTV around to prevent what we don’t want in the state. We must be ahead of every situation in our state.”
The TraderMoni scheme is President Muhammadu Buhari’s social intervention programme executed through the Bank of Industry to provide interest-free and collateral-free loans ranging from N10,000 to N100,000 to petty traders and artisans, while the N-Power scheme is a component of the National Social Investment Programme aimed at providing a structure for skill acquisition and development.
