For fear of being attacked by bandits and Boko Haram, some communities in Niger state have negotiated a peace deal with the terrorists.
Recall that the governor of the state, Sanni Bello recently confirmed that insurgents have taken over five local governments in the state, including Kaure axis in Shiroro Local Government Area in the state and Munya LGA.
Communities who have negotiated with Boko Haram after reaching an agreement to pay a certain amount of money, included communities in Gurmana, Manta, Bassa and Kukoki districts in the Shiroro area of the state.
Yusuf Sani, the co-convener of Concerned Shiroro Youth said the communities had paid “not less than N20 million to sign the peace deal with the terrorists.”
He said the communities had also purchased at least six motorcycles worth N500,000 for the terrorists.
Yusuf Sani added that: “This is what most of the communities are resorting to. By my records now, communities that have signed the peace deal with the terrorists are more than 40.
“While some communities have already sealed up deals for a ceasefire with the terrorists and are currently reaping the benefits, others are on the verge of finalizing theirs.”
