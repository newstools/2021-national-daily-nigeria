Bandits are getting deadlier in their invasion of communities in northwest Nigeria. a gang of bandits on Wednesday struck in over six communities in Zamfara State, killing about 50 persons, while several others were injured.
The bandits were said to have invaded over six communities on Wednesday in Magami Ward of Gusau Local Government Area and Maru Local Government Area, Zamfara State.
The casualties were said to be members of the local vigilante group in the communities, Yansakai, who volunteered to protect the invaded communities.
The bandits were said to have invaded the communities in the early hours of Wednesday, shooting sporadically into the air in their usual intimidation tradition to clear their way for operations.
The  vigilante group volunteers had attempted to resist and repel the bandits from invading the communities but were unfortunately overwhelmed by the invaders who operated with sophisticated weapons.
The invaded communities were identified to include Kangon farimana, Ruwan dawa, Yargada, Kunkelai, Yarzaiga, Yar doka Gobirawa, Bayan Banki, and Biyabiki in Gusau and Maru Local Government Areas.
The Police Command in Zamfara State had acknowledged the invasion. The police command regretted that troops could not reach the scene of the attack since they did not receive notification early because absence of mobile phone network in the areas.
The police, however, disclosed that troops attached to operation Puff Adder II located in Magami had gone to the locations on foot to forestall further attacks on neighbouring communities by the bandits, noting that response was still being awaited to confirm details of the damages and casualties.
Bandits appear to have grown in population and might, having the capacity for spontaneous attacks at several parts of the northwest with minimal resistance or military intervention.
