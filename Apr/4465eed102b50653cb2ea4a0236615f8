Wife of Ekiti Governor, Mrs Bisi Fayemi, has called for speedy dispensation of justice on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) to help reduce the decadence.
Mrs Fayemi made the call on Tuesday during an advocacy visit to School of Nursing and Midwifery in Ado Ekiti.
The governor’s wife said concerted efforts should made to nip the manace in the bud.
“When there is delay or no sanctions for violent sexual assaults, the culture of impunity on the heinous crime continues to thrive and gives rise to the manace in an unprecedented proportion,” she said.
She expressed regret that women who were victims of violent sexual crimes were most times  afraid to report them for fear of stigmatisation, blame and rejection.
According to her gender-based violence destroys lives, erodes self esteem, brings educational opportunities to a halt and increases sexual transmitted diseases, among others.
Earlier, the Chief Medical Director of Ekiti State Teaching Hospital, Prof. Kayode Olabanji, urged the students of the school to see themselves as ambassadors of advocacy against gender-based violence.
Olabanji urged them to propagate the dangers inherent in the menace so as to curb it.
In his remarks,  the Principal of the school, Mrs Bisi Awe, gave the assurance that the institution would put in place measures to eliminate gender-based violence.
She promised immediate inauguration of a gender-based violence club in the school so as to report suspicious cases of the dastardly act to the appropriate quarters.
