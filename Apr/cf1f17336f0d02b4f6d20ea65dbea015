Barely days after a popular Yoruba actor, Olarenwaju James (Baba Ijesha), was arrested for defiling a minor, another actor, known as Lege Miami has been accused of raping a minor.
Lege Miami was also one of those who defended Baba Ijesha when others called him out.
This new revelation was made known by a popular Instagram blogger, Gist Lover.
In the post, the actor was said to have raped a 16-year-old girl with a promise to give her a movie role.
The blogger further threatens to expose Lege Miami as he urged everyone who the actor has raped in the past to speak up.
The blogger wrote: Lege Miami we want to throw back to that incident that happened at your residence some years back at Iwaya lagos, how you raped a 16 -year old jambite, the girl is in the DM like this, you don Dey do am ever don tey, the girl you raped that you lied to her say you go give am role too, we Dey gather all of them…
It would be recalled that James, aka Baba Ijesha, was last week arrested by the police following complaints by one Princess Adekola Adekanya at Sabo Police Station that he defiled her 14-year old daughter.
