“We are going to support MSMEs with grants to improve their businesses, especially those that found it difficult to pay salaries due to COVID-19 and those that need to acquire IT facilities to enhance their businesses,” he said.
He said that the project was for years and would start in 2021, adding that the board would have list centres where MSMEs in the state would be supported.

According to him, the board is one of the top three in the state in terms of impacting meaningful to society as the role of MSMEs in economic development cannot be overemphasized.
