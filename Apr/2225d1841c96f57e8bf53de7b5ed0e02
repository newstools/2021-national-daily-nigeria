Mr Lawrence Kwaghga, the North Central Coordinator, National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA),
says the prevalence rate of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (Aids) has dropped.
Kwaghga, who disclosed this on Wednesday when he paid a visit to Gov. Samuel Ortom in Makurdi, said the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate dropped from 12.9 per cent to 4.7 per cent in Benue, representing 8.2 per cent.
He acknowledged the support of Benue Government in the fight against the spread of the scourge, noting that
the desire of NACA and the world in general was to end spread of HIV/AIDS by 2030.
The coordinator, who stressed the need for increased budgetary allocation to the state and zonal offices of NACA to achieve the set goals, called for sustained and increased funding from government at all levels.
He also appealed for the revival of local offices of the agency for improved service delivery, pointing out that government’s support in terms of funding at that point was imperative.
In a remark, Gov. Samuel Ortom expressed delight over the drop in the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS and pledged his administration’s support for the agency to achieve the set objectives.
Ortom pledged improved funding for the agency in the state and acknowledged the support of donor agencies and development partners to the fight against the spread of the deadly scourge.
