Fuji singer, Wasiu Alabi Pasuma, stole the show at his daughter’s wedding on Thursday. He was spotted shedding tears and the video instantly became social media sensation.
The wedding ceremony was a beautiful moment for Pasuma and her daughter, Oyindamola, who married her heartthrob, Olajuwon.
When fellow Fuji maestro, Mayegun Wasiu Ayinde, K1 De Utimate, started singing at the wedding reception, an emotional Pasuma couldn’t hold back his tears. While the reason for the sober mood is not certain, fans described it as tears of joy for witnessing the occasion.
Pasuma in such a mood is rare to his fans as the musician is known for his daring personality due to his background (Mushin, Lagos) and style of music.
The musician reportedly has 3 baby mamas and 10 children – 8 girls and 2 boys. Their names are Wasilat Odetola, Oyindamola Odetola, Aaliyah Odetola, Opeyemi Odetola, Amirah Odetola, Rookebat Odetola, Wariz Odetola, Junior Odetola and Farooq Odetola.
