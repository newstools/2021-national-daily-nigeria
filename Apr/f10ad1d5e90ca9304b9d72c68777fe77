Igbogbo-Baiyeku Local Council Development Area(LCDA) of Lagos State has embarked on repair and palliative works on canals and drainages to make the roads passable ahead of the rainy season.
The Council Chairman, Mr Olusesan Daini, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) during an inspection of the road works on Wednesday that the intervention would reduce flooding, accidents and ease movement of motorists during the rainy season.
He said that the road repairs would be done in phases, adding that the council has completed rehabilitation of Igbe road, link roads between Basorun bus-stop and Garage and recently graded Ofin/Oreta and Igbogbo/Bayeku roads.
“I know it is important to improve the state of our roads, especially this time when we are approaching the rainy season.
“One of the focal points of this administration is infrastructure development to improve economic activities that will attract more investors in our community.
“In this regard, we lay more emphasis on infrastructure development and road construction as outlined in our manifesto during our campaign in 2017.
“Our plan is to put palliatives on roads that are vulnerable to flooding, clear the drainage and canals for easy passage of water and rehabilitate as many as possible link roads to ease traffic,” Daini said.
According to him, grading will be done on all the flood prone roads to alleviate the suffering of residents in preparation for the coming rainy season.
The chairman said the council has also graded Market Street and upgraded Kaniyi market to an Ultra modern standard, while the construction of Magistrates’ Court has commenced inside the Secretariat to enhance the justice system.
“We have also commenced the construction of the Magistrate court to facilitate our justice system funded by Odofin of Ikorodu,” he said.
