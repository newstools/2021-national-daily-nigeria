Chairman of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) Danladi Umar and the security guard he attacked at the popular Banex Plaza in Wuse 2, Abuja are now under investigation over the assault.
Nigerians have called for the prosecution of Danladi seen attacking the guard in a viral video days ago.
The FCT Police Command in a statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Yusuf Mariam, said the command would be fair and professional in the conduct of its investigation.
“Following the incident of alleged assault involving the CCT Chairman and a security guard that took place at Bannex Plaza on Monday March 29th,2021, the command wishes to state categorically that discreet investigation is still ongoing.
“Hence, the Commissioner of Police CP Bala Ciroma wishes to reassure members of the public that the command will be professional, fair and thorough in its investigation.”
He appealed to residents to allow the law to take its course.
Danldi is another public office holder to have engaged in slapping down ordinary citizens in public for no justcause.
Sen. Elisha Abbo beat up an attendant in a sex-toy shop in Abuja in 2019.
