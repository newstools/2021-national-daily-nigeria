The northwest PDP congress ended in chaos on Saturday as thugs moved in and unleashed violence on the election held at the Kaduna International Trade Fair Complex.
The thugs were suspected to have been sponsored by one of the aspirants contending for the leadership of the region.
“Voting has gone far. I think four states have cast their votes when some miscreants stormed the venue and went straight to the boxes and destroyed them,” a source was quoted as saying by the Tribune.
The two contenders in the election are Senator Bello Hayatu Gwarzo and Muhammad Jamo Yusuf, both from Kano State.
Gwarzo apparently had the backing of the PDP governors in the northwest, and Aminu Wali, a factional leader of the state party.
Yusuf however has the support of former Gov Rabiu Kwakwanso who is also a leader of anther faction.
The PDP has yet to react officially.
The northwest geo-political zones comprises Kano, Katsina, Kaduna, Zamfara, Sokoto, Jigawa, Kebbi
