Founder of House on the Rock, Pastor Paul Adefarasin, says it’s time Nigerians addressed the 1999 constitution, describing it as faulty and foisted on Nigerians by a few soldiers and their surrogates.
Adafarasin who disclosed this in a trending video said anything short of a brand new constitution for Nigeria in the next administration is simply a fraud.
“Look at the resilience of Nigerians around the world, they excelled, the problem is not Nigerians, it is Nigeria and its constitution. The document upon which we were formed, it was a few soldiers who put it together and their surrogates and that is what is probably holding us together; the foundation is that document and if that foundation is faulty, what can the righteous do? We have got to go back to the foundation.
“The next administration must not access power until we have a veritable constitution that is truly the document of we the people, anything else is a fraud, Nigeria is a scam and it is perpetuating itself too long,” he said.
According to Adefarasin, it is time to do something about it, saying that no politician has the right to talk to “us on this matter unless they believe as we believe on this matter, Nigeria can do better, we are suffering in Nigeria in our hundreds of millions.
“We could easily be one of the top three countries in the world with the kind of resources we have. And it is about time we let the international community know that there must be purpose, don’t tell us you are protecting democracy, don’t tell us you are looking for free and fair election, which election has been free and fair in this country except the closest to it is Abiola and Babagana Kingibe which was annulled?”
“Nigeria has lost her mind, we want people not only who can handle development, but must be disabused of religionism and ethnicism and terrorism. If you have ever been associated with terrorism, you cannot be our leader,” he added.
