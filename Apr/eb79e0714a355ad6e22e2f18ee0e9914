The Nigerian is beginning to panic over the rising intractable insecurity in several parts of the country. The frequency of kidnapping, killings and invasion of communities, which are now daily occurrence, have become worrisome to the Nigerian government.
The Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi retired, had expressed concerns over the high frequency of kidnapping and use of deadly weapons in the operations. The minister, however, disclosed nine weapons have been recovered from some captured bandits, who he said will be prosecuted by the government. He further confirmed that some Boko Haram sponsors were arrested recently in Kano State.
Retired General Magashi stated that he does not support that all bandits will be killed, as advocated by Governor Nasi El-Rufai of Kaduna State. The minister contended that every person is innocent as prescribed by the law until found guilty.
Magashi, however, agreed that any bandit found in the forest with an Ak-47 rifle will be immediately gunned down in accordance with the presidential directive.
The Presidency had ordered in March that the security agencies should shoot at sight anyone in illegal possession of AK-47 rifles.
The Defence Minister also expressed phobia that there will be problems in the country if the lingering insecurity in Chad escalates since the death of the former Chadian President, Idris Deby, who died on April 20 from injuries sustained in gin battle with rebels in the country.
The Nigerian Defence Minister noted that “the federal government is not unmindful of the threats of proliferation of weapons that may arise and a possible influx of refugees in consequence, thus, security around the borders of the nation have been heightened.”
