The Imo Correctional Centre was on, and no fewer than 1500 prisoners escaped on April 5 morning.
The attack was said to have been carried out by armed hoodlums who invaded the facility early on Monday.
It all began with sporadic shooting that lasted for three hours before the centre was bombed.
The jailbreak took place in spite of IGP Mohammed Adamuâ€™s order to keep the Easter period safe.
Imo CP Nasiru Mohammed also said that he had deployed over 4760 personnel to ensure maximum security during and after the Easter celebration.
This is the second jailbreak between October 2020 and April 2021.
The first took place during the ENDSARS violence in Edo.
