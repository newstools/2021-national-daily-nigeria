Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers state, has further imposed restrictions on vehicular and human movement as part of measure to curb the rising violence in the state against security operatives.

Recall that some security personnel were recently attacked in Ikwerre and Abua/Odual local government areas of the state by unknown gunmen, leaving two officers dead and several others injured.

The state government had then subsequently imposed a night time curfew on all Rivers state land borders with the states.

But speaking after the Rivers state security council meeting on Thursday, Governor Wike said it has become necessary to further put up more measures to combat the rising insecurity in the state and also to protect its citizens.

He said a review of the present security situation shows that the threat of further deadly attacks on hard and soft targets across the State still exists.

“Accordingly, the State Security Council has, today, after exhaustive deliberation, decided and advised that a statewide curfew on human and vehicular movements be imposed as part of additional measures to prevent the faceless criminals from unleashing their
deadly actions.

“Consequently, a night curfew is hereby imposed on the entire 23 Local Government Areas of the State prohibiting any human and or vehicular movement within or any part of the State from 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. from today 29th April 2021 until further notice.

“We wish to repeat that in taking these and other drastic measures at this time, our singular intention is to secure our State and guarantee the protection of lives and property.

He therefore called for the continued understanding of the people, advising everyone to be vigilant and promptly report every suspicious movement in your neighbourhood to the security agencies for immediate actions.
