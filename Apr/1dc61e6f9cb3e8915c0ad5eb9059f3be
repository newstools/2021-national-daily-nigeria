The Ondo State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Akure, has fixed April 23rd, 2021 to deliver judgement on the petition filed by candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), Eyitayo Jegede, against the victory of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu.
Jegede, in the petition, is asking the tribunal to uphold the victory of Governor Akeredolu.
Jegede had alleged in the petition that Governor Akeredolu and his Deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, were not validly nominated by the All Progressives Congress(APC).
He is asking the tribunal to declare him winner of the election.
The three-man panel led by Justice Umar Abubakar announced the date for judgement in a notice sent to all parties in the suit.
Counsel in the suit had in February adopted their written addresses before the Tribunal.
Jegede did not call another of the 400 witnesses he promised to testify as he closed his case after his testimony.
Defence Counsel urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition on grounds that the petitioner failed to prove that Governor Akeredolu and his Deputy were not validly nominated.
They said the petitioners were inconsistent in their pleadings and added that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to interpret section 183 of the constitution as prayed for by the petitioner.
