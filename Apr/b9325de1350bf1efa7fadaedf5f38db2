Cristiano Ronaldo could be approaching his 37th birthday at the next summer transfer window, but his strength and desire to win has not relented in any way.
 
The qualities of the Portuguese talisman who is yet to confirm his plans beyond this season through the years are unquestionable.
 
There have been claims that the multiple Ballon D’or award winner could leave Juventus for a sensational return to either Real Madrid or Manchester United.
 
National Daily can recall that Ronaldo who undoubtedly still cherishes his Red Devils days has discussed the idea of a possible return to the Old Trafford as far back as in 2014.
 
“I love Manchester. Everyone knows that. Manchester is in my heart. The supporters are amazing and I wish I can come back one day.”
National Daily can further confirm that United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer himself has not hidden his desires for a possible reunion with the Juventus forward.
The Norwegian tactician did not forget Ronaldo when previously asked which of his Man United 1999 treble-winning teammates he would love to have in his squad today as a manager.
After naming Roy Keane and Paul Scholes, Solskjaer said: “Don’t forget I played with Cristiano and he’s the best player in the world – so I wouldn’t mind having him in my team too.”
Thankfully, the Red Devils victory over their erstwhile manager Jose Mourinho and Tottenham last Sunday has all but helped them secure a Champions League football next season.
The aforementioned achievement clearly means more money at the disposal of Solskjaer and the Red Devils this summer and the feat has made Ronaldo a transfer target for United according to Calciomercato via Sport Witness.
And with a hopeful return of fans to the stadiums next season, it will definitely be a delight for United fans to see one of their favorites Ronaldo make a sensational homecoming at Old Trafford.
