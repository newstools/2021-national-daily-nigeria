Tottenham Hotspurs on Monday fired Jose Mourinho as manager of the team about one week to the Carabao final game with Manchester City.
Mourinho’s presence in Tottenham has not been able to change things in the club which has been struggling for survival in the English Premier League since last season. In the current season, Tottenham have not been able to make the top four of the League table to qualify for the European Champions League competition next season.
Tottenham in a statement on the club’s website, declared: “The Club can today announce that Jose Mourinho and his coaching staff Joao Sacramento, Nuno Santos, Carlos Lalin, and Giovanni Cerra have been relieved of their duties.”
Chairman of Tottenham, Daniel Levy, commended Mourinho for his professionalism and enormous toughness during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Jose is a true professional who showed enormous resilience during the pandemic.
“On a personal level, I have enjoyed working with him and regret that things have not worked out as we both had envisaged.
“He will always be welcome here and we should like to thank him and his coaching staff for their contribution,” Levy said.
 
The statement further indicated that a former Tottenham midfielder, Ryan Mason, would take over as caretaker coach in the interim.
“Ryan Mason will take First Team training today and a further update will follow in due course,” the club stated.
Mourinho took over Tottenham Spurs in November 2019, replacing Mauricio Pochettino.
