After years of power tussle, Oyo Gov Seyi Makinde and Ekiti ex-Gov Ayo Fayose have kissed and made up.
Fayose had fought vigorously, to the point of fragmenting their party PDP over who leads the party in the southwest—the region where Makinde is the only PDP governor.
The tussle got so bad a special committee headed by ex-Sen. President Bukola Saraki had to intervene in Osogbo.
Speaking at the Wocdiff Centre, venue of the reconciliation, Fayose said, “The Governor of Oyo State, Governor Seyi Makinde, my brother, my friend and by the grace of God, our leader.”
He also apologised to members of the party in Makinde’s faction for putting them through hell over the years.
“Nothing last forever. if I offend anybody, I apologise,” he added.“I and Seyi Makinde are one from the beginning.”
He prayed Makinde’s leadership in the South-West will usher the PDP into a season of great accomplishments.
