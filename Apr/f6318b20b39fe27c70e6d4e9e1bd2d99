United Nations special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths called on warring parties in the country’s six-year conflict to halt fighting during the month of Ramadan.
Griffiths said in a message marking the Muslim fasting month, which began in Yemen and many other countries on Tuesday.
“I wish the people of Yemen a blessed and peaceful Ramadan.
“I call on the parties to silence the guns and allow Yemenis to observe the month in safety and dignity and put every effort towards achieving what Yemenis aspire for, a lasting and sustainable peace.
“I hope this holy month of reflection and compassion will provide an opportunity for all of us to come together, think of those who are suffering, and overcome our differences,’’ he said.
Yemen has been roiled by a devastating power struggle since late 2014, when the Houthi rebels seized the capital Sana’a and other areas in the country.
Months later, when the rebels advanced towards the temporary capital, Aden, Saudi Arabia formed a military coalition backing the Yemeni government and its forces in March 2015 against the Iran-linked Houthis.
The conflict has pushed Yemen to the verge of famine and devastated its health facilities.
The Coronavirus pandemic also aggravated the economic crisis in the country.
