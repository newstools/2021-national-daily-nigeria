UN human rights experts on Tuesday demanded proof of life and clear information on the whereabouts of Princess Latifa, a daughter of Dubai’s ruler, whose fate has attracted international attention.
Friends of Sheikha Latifa had released a video in February in which the princess said she was being detained against her will in a Dubai villa after she tried to escape the emirate in early 2018 in an inflatable boat.
She was stopped by a special commando unit off the Indian coast and forcibly returned to Dubai, her friends reported.
Dubai’s ruling family said at the time that Latifa was being cared for by her family and medical staff.
“We are alarmed that following the public release in February of footage in which Sheikha Latifa reported being deprived of her liberty against her will, and the subsequent official request for further information on her situation, no concrete information has been provided by the authorities,’’ experts working with the UN human rights off in Geneva said in a statement.
An older sister of Latifa’s was kidnapped from Cambridge in 2000 and taken to Dubai after she tried to abscond.
The family’s statement said that Latifa was being cared for was not enough, said the independent rights experts, whose work includes issues such as torture, discrimination against women and girls, torture, and disappearances.
“Her continued incommunicado detention can have harmful physical and psychological consequences and may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,’’ they said.
