Nigerian ex-international, Mutiu Adepoju, has advised the nation’s youths to remain focused and hardworking in the pursuit of their future goals.
Adepoju, popularly called “headmaster’’ during his playing days, gave the advice at a youth mentorship programme, entitled: “Youths: The need for guidance’’, held in Enugu on Tuesday.
He also advised the youths to “try to be patient” and always respect other people’s views “to avoid costly errors that might mar their future pursuits”.
He said that as a youth footballer, he got into international football and was able to make it by being focused and hardworking.
“You must eschew acts of violence, crime and bad association for you to be focused with your ambition in life,’’ he said.
Adepoju, who is Spanish La Liga Ambassador, is also an ambassador of the Police Campaign Against Cultism and Other Vices (POCACOV).
In a speech, the National Coordinator of POCACOV, CSP Ebere Amaraizu, charged youths to always listen to their heartbeat for self-discovery through entrepreneurial skills.
Amaraizu said some youths appeared to be everything at a time, pointing out that “such a situation conflicts with the power of focus’’.
He advised youths to get involved in strategic thinking, planning and positive implementation of their workable strategies.
The Convener of the programme, Mrs Nnenna Anozie, a Youth Mentor and Life Coach, said there was a need to help Nigerian youths to always know how to achieve their goal through workable strategies.
“This programme will help equip youths with basic ingredients that will help them to achieve their strategies and future ambitions,’’ Anozie said.
