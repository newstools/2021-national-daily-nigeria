The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), says the sustained secret abduction of its members would not go unpunished as members of the Eastern Security Network will respond proportionately.
In a statement by the Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB vowed to avenge the blood of innocent Biafrans through its security outfit.
It reads in part: “Where are the military helicopter gunboats that were buzzing over Orlu airspace in search of ESN operatives in February? Where are the heavily armed brutal soldiers that massacred unarmed Biafran agitators in morning exercise at Emene?
“Where are the wicked DSS operatives’ daily hunting and abducting IPOB members and other Biafran agitators? Just yesterday, DSS abducted Elizabeth Ozioma Onyeaka, an IPOB member in Anambra North Senatorial zone.
“Armed DSS personnel invaded their home between 2:00 and 2: 30am and took her away and till now they have kept her incommunicado. Secret abduction of IPOB members has continued unabated.
“These terrorists in security uniform are zealously arresting unarmed and peaceful agitators but too weak and unwilling to touch their fellow terrorists smoking lives out of innocent Indigenous Nigerians. Why can’t Nigeria Fulani terrorists in military uniform trace those that attacked 4 villages in Ebonyi and Enugu States?
“But we assure them that these genocides will not go unpunished. Our gallant ESN personnel will respond proportionately! We are prepared for them. We knew a time like this will come, and that was why our proactive Leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu floated ESN ahead of time to defend Biafrans against these blood suckers.”
