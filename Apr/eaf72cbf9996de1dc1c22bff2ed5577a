The Lagos State Citizens’ Mediation Centre (CMC) has successfully restored the family of Mr Olalekan Balogun, which was rendered homeless by their aggrieved landlord, to their apartment after being locked out for 18 days.
The Public Affairs Officer of the CMC, Mrs Olaide Popoola, made this known in a statement issued in Lagos  on Wednesday.
According to the Popoola, the landlord had allegedly rendered the family homeless by seizing their belongings and denying them access to their apartment due to failure to pay rent.
The family of five was allegedly unable to meet up with the rent payment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which had adversely affected the family business.
Popoola said that Balogun had reported the matter to the police at the Meiran Police Station, Lagos, but all efforts of the police proved abortive as the landlord failed to honour their invitation.
The tenant had also noted that he and his family were poorly treated by his landlord.
“All I had for many days was the clothes on my body because my landlord denied us access into our apartment.
“I could not meet up with payment of rent due to the COVID-19 pandemic which adversely affected my small scale business,” he said
The CMC said it had brought succour to the homeless family by inviting both parties to some mediation sessions where the misunderstanding between them was resolved.
“The family was granted full access to their apartment and belongings. In addition, the family was given an extension of a two-month stay in the apartment till May 31, 2021.
“The total sum of N170, 000 was also waived from the house rent arrears to further ease the eventual relocation of Mr Balogun and his family to a new property on or before May 31, 2021,” the CMC said.
