The Biafra Nations League (BNL) has flayed the Inspector General of Police, IG Mohammed Adamu, for concluding that members of the Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) carried out the attack in Owerri, Imo State, on Monday.

The Deputy National Leader of BNL, Ebuta Akor Takon, in Ikom, Cross River State, argued that the IG of Police concluded without an investigation, protesting that guessing work does not show
professionalism.

Ebuta Akor Takon berated the IG that he has never accused the Fulani herdsmen, especially, in recent attacks in Ebonyi State.

The BNL was of the view that gunmen who are attacking officers and prisons might be expressing their anger in retaliation to the killings, harassments and extortion by the security agencies.

The BNL Chief of Staff, Linus Essien, in a separate statement in Bakassi Peninsula cautioned of the potential consequences of attacking pro Biafra agitators irrespective of group affiliations. The BNL
observed that the police will end arresting innocent people and not the gunmen. The group warned that such actions have repercussions.

Meanwhile,Â  the Inspector General of Police, IGP Adamu, has deployed a crack team to thoroughly investigate the Imo attacks and release of over 1,887 inmates from prisons.
