The rising tension in Imo State is getting higher as uncertainties of insecurity continue to become worse. The unrestrained attack on police stations by unknown gunmen has become a source of perturbation for residents of Imo State.
Another police station was attacked on Tuesday and burnt by gunmen after the attack and bombing of the Police Headquarters in Owerri, on Monday.
It was indicated that the Tuesday inferno occurred at the Divisional Police Headquarters in Ehime Mbano Local Government Area, Imo State, an outskirt of Owerri, the state capital.
The gunmen, who were said to have arrived the scene in large numbers in buses, opened the detention cells and set free all suspects, and thereafter, set the police station ablaze.
The Police Command, however, said the armoury at the station was not taken away.
The Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, was said to have acknowledged: “Ehime Mbano (Police) Division has just been attacked, no casualty on the part of the police, no loss of arms, three vehicles burnt.”
Some stakeholders in the view had expressed the fear that the IPOB is becoming a sort of Boko Haram in the southeast. However, the attacks on the police stations in Imo State have not been authoritatively established to be carried out by IPOB.
