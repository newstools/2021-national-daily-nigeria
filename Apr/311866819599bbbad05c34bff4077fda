A Muslim Cleric, Alfa Abdulmumeen Ajisafe, on Friday enjoined Muslims to remember the indigents in their communities while breaking their fast in the spirit of Ramadan.
Ajisafe, who made the call in his Ramadan lecture in Ilorin, explained that Ramadan is a holy month of reaching out to the less privileged in our midst, hence advising that they share food among the indigents.
According to him, Ramadan is not only about abstaining from foods, drinks and sexual intercourse, it also entails God-consciousness where an individual abstains from all evils.
“The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) has enjoined the feeding of the poor according to our capability and means.
“It is not good for a Muslim to have a full stomach while his neighbour feels the pang of hunger,” he said.
Ajisafe, who is also the Secretary of Huswatul-Saliheen, a faith based organisation, reminded Muslims that they should constantly read the Holy Qur’an, saying that Ramadan is the month when the holy Qur’an was sent down to the holy Prophet.
“Ramadan is a month of forgiveness and it is enjoined that you intensify prayers especially at night,” he said.
He added that those who keep malice with others must desist and reach out to them to make peace.
The cleric warned that those who do not desist from evil Allah does not need their fasting because it will be in vain.
“Have the spirit of forgiveness for those who do wrong to you and desist from foul language and keep away from malice,” he said.
