Abubakar Shekau is out for blood of some of the leading members of Boko Haram faction he leads, reshuffling the Shura (consultative) cabinet and eliminating the rats among them.
Shekau just killed his Amrul Jaysh (war commander) Abu Fatimah, replacing him with Abu Muhammad.
According to PRNigeria, Shekau personally shot and killed Abu Fatimah last week for allegedly betraying the sect.
Shekau also eliminated two other senior commanders.
“Following an internal dispute, Shekau killed Abu Fatima, one other Commander and Amirul Fi’ya, a son to a renowned Bama businessman, Alhaji Modu Katakauma,” PRNigeria quoted an informant as saying.
The National Daily earlier reported the findings of the Institute of Security Studies of Nigeria detailing how over 4000 jihadists have deserted the group owing to high-handedness of Shekau, among other reasons.
