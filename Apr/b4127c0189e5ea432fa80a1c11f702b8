Equity International’s Country director for Nigeria, Chris Iyama, explained that this debate is set to feature seasoned medical and legal practitioners as they prove or debunk facts or myths on Covid19 and its vaccination.

He stressed that the rise of theories and myths around Covid19 vaccination is undoubtedly affecting the roll out of vaccines and a debate like this will help provide information for the people to decide as regards taking or not taking the vaccine.
In a press statement made available to National Daily, Chris further explained that Nigerians have a right to decide for themselves, and for them to make the best decisions, all facts and truths on covid and vaccines must be presented and this debate is the first of several to shed light on this.

Recall that a seeming controversy heralded the launch of COVID-19 vaccine administration particularly in Nigeria as many have argued that there is no need for a vaccine when the recovery rate is almost 98% while the rate of fatality is almost less than 2%. And gradually, after making promises to citizens that they will not be compelled to take the vaccine, the Federal Government through its agencies are now subtly making it compulsory in some quarters.
It is in the light of the above that the need for citizens to engage and have a say in this vaccine administration in the country cannot be overemphasized.
