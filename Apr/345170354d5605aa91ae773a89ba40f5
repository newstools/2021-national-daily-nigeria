Chief of Army Staff, Maj Gen Attairu Ibrahim engaged the House of Representatives ad hoc committee investigating arms procurement in a war of words when he appeared before them on Monday.
The lawmaker wanted to exact an apology from him for missing previous invitation by the House on March 22 and April 7.
But Attahiru jibbed.
“Even a blind man knows that there are internal security challenges in the country. The same way you work for the people, that is the same way I work for the people. I have a command under me and they are also Nigerians,” he told the committee.
He also refused to speak on the report he submitted to the committee.
According to him, the executive summary should suffice.
As expected, some of the lawmakers lost their cool, asking him to speak under oath.
“COAS to speak under oath, to be sure that it emanated from the office of the COAS,” Hon Bede Eke said.
The federal lawmakers like to be treated with utmost respect when dealing with executive appointees.
A committee overseeing the Nigeria Customs Service had similar problem with Comptroller Hammed Ali, a retired colonel, when they visited the headquarters in the eight assembly.
Led by then Sen. Dino Melaye, the lawmakers expressed dissatisfaction as the NCS boss refused to come downstairs to welcome them.
Ali also refused to wear the service uniform.
