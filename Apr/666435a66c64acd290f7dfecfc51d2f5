The secretary of the Ilana Omooduwa Youth Initiatives, Dr. Akin Adejumo said Nigeria is not working and there is need for Nigerians to go back to the drawing board and take a profitable decision for their people.
But the National President of Yoruba Welfare group (YWG), Comrade Abdulhakeem Adegoke Alawuje, said that those clamouring for Oodua Republic cannot decide for the Yoruba people.
The group, according to the Daily Trust, blasted the secession advocates, accusing them of attempting to destroy the peace, love and harmony of Yoruba land.
“We are issuing a last warning to those behind the political agitation to stop all this rubbish in our land. Yoruba land cannot be a testing ground for any form of criminal act,” he said.
“YWG is calling all traditional rulers in Yoruba land to call these people to order, because it will not favour all of us to start mobilizing against ourselves in the same region.”
While the Akintoye group is urging the southwest not to partake in the 2023 general election, the PDP southwest region elected its national vice chairman days ago in a congress.
Other political groups have mobilized hundreds of Yoruba people in support of APC national leader apparently gunning for the presidency in 2023.
