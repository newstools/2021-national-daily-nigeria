Tech giant Apple Inc. on Monday said it had accelerated its U.S. investments, with plans to make new contributions of more than 430 billion dollars.
Apple is now raising its level of commitment by 20 per cent over the next five years.
This includes tens of billions of dollars for next-generation silicon development and 5G innovation across nine U.S. states.
Apple said it was on track to meet its 2018 goal of creating 20,000 new jobs in the U.S. by 2023.
The company noted that it was carbon neutral for all of its offices in the United States and around the world, and last year committed to be 100 per cent carbon neutral for its entire supply chain and products by 2030.
