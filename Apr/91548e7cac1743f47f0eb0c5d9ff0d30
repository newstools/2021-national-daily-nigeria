Mr Sunday Kwassau, an Animal Health and Production Management Veterinarian, has advised livestock farmers to always engage services of veterinary doctors for proper care of their pets and livestock.
Kwassau told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja that such care was necessary in order to prevent further spread of bird flu and other animal diseases in the country.
The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control on April 6 confirmed the outbreak of bird flu in seven states.
These states are Kano, Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Nasarawa, Kaduna and Niger.
According to Kwassau, the role of the veterinary doctor remains critical in protecting the health and well-being of both animals and people.
“With the outbreak of bird flu in the country, farmers should not use drugs indiscriminately but consult their veterinary doctors who can diagnose and control animal diseases and treat sick and injured animals.
“Farmers should not consult their co-farmers; they should consult veterinary doctors always if they want to use drugs.
“If they use antibiotics indiscriminately, it can lead to drug resistance.
“And by the time they have an outbreak on their farm, if they want to use the antibiotics they have been abusing; it will not give them the desired result,’’ he said.
Kwassau advised people to avoid contact with wild live birds or recently dead poultry, especially if bird flocks had experienced widespread sudden deaths.
“Wash hands often, and routinely clean areas, surfaces, and objects that come in contact with birds, bird products or bird droppings,’’ he added.
