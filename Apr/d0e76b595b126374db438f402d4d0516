The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Kano/Jigawa Area Command, says it generated a total of N7.658 billion revenue in the first quarter (Q1) of 2021.
 
The Customs Area Comptroller, Mr Suleiman Pai-Umar, disclosed this at a news conference on Thursday in Kano.
 
Pai-Umar said that N2.947 billion was generated in January, N2.562 billion in February and N2.147 in March.
 
He said that the figure represented more than 100 per cent increase in duty collection, as against the N3.898 billion recorded within the same period in 2020.
 
Pai-Umar said that the service also made various seizures, with a Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N38 .564 million within the period under review.
 
He said that the seizures were made through intelligence gathering at different times and locations in his command’s area of operation.
 
The NCS chief listed the seized goods to include: 716 bags of rice, 90 bales of used clothes, 162 cartons of pasta, 85 cartons of macaroni, 240 cartons of soap and two cartons of milk.
 
He also said that the service arrested two suspects in connection with the seizures, adding that they would be charged to court as soon as investigations were concluded.
 
“It is very unfortunate and disturbing that despite the awareness of the dire consequences of smuggling activities on economic growth and development, some citizens still perpetuate this criminal act for their selfish interests.
 
“The NCS’s zero tolerance for smuggling is non-negotiable and the service will do everything in its capacity to fight it,” he said.
 
While commending the personnel for their dedication to duty, Pai-Umar lauded other security agencies and community leaders for their support to the service.
 
The comptroller also urged the media to educate people on the ills of smuggling and the need to promote legitimate trade in the society.
