The Boko Haram terrorists were said to have distributed pamphlets during the operation, threatening the people to either support their struggle to establish a Muslim caliphate or be killed.
It was gathered the one-page pamphlet, read inter alia: “Our major aim: to uplift the word of Allah, protect the religion of Islam and the wealth of the followers.
“Our target: those who do not believe in our ideology, Christians and even Muslims who do not believe in our teachings.
“Any Muslim who is not supporting the empire of Islam is our target.
“Anyone who comes to us for forgiveness and stop fighting us will be exempted from attacks.”
