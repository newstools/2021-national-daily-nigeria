The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, SAN, at the weekend defended the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari in his leadership of Nigeria and inability to tackle the problems in the country. Keyamo in a tweet attempted to exonerate President Buhari from the endemic killings and destruction of rural communities by Fulani herdsmen, kidnappings and killings by bandits in the northwest and the Boko Haram terrorism in the northeast, besides the collapsed economy. The Minister of State expressed that insecurity is a global crisis.
He, therefore, admonished Nigerians to stop ethnicising and politicising insecurity in the country, insisting that security threats remain a global issue.
Keyamo in a statement on his official Twitter page, @fkeyamo, on Friday, cited recent shootings in the US, declaring that insecurity is a global phenomenon that has affected every country, saying that the threat is not something to be politicized.
Keyamo in the tweeted statement declared: “Yet, another mass shooting in the USA today. The statistics in the US is staggering.
“However, it is no excuse for our state of insecurity, and it is immoral for us to compare and say ours is even lesser.
“But we should stop ethnicism and politicising what is clearly a global phenomenon.”
The Minister may have apparently be urging Nigerians to accept insecurity as occurring across the country. Otherwise, the sources of the insecurity should be denied or ignored, even when known or when accepted publicly by some groups or cultural leaders.
