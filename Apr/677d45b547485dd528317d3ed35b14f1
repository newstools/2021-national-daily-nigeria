A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Rev Godwin Okonkwo has explained he chose the party to take Anambra State to the centre
The Anglican cleric, who declared his interest at the APC Secretariat in Awka at the weekend, claimed the All Progressives Grand Alliance APGA (APGA) had been wooing him in the State
He said his decision to team up with APC was inspired by his understanding of Anambra political system and developmental challenges, adding that Anambra was too big a State to play local politics.
Okonkwo said his experience as a retired Director of Accounts, and Managing Director (Capital) of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) puts him in a better position to manage the affairs of the State and deliver the much needed dividends of democracy to Ndi Anambra.
He appealed to APC members to consider the personality, antecedents and capacity of the candidate they choose.
According to him: “Anambra State cannot work without being at the centre. Time has come for the restoration of this State
“I have come to vie for the governorship of Anambra State on this platform. We must fear God but we have to respect out elders and leaders and that is the only way forward. I am that change Anambra State needs.”
Anambra chairman of the party, Chief Basil Ejidike, maintained that APC would conduct a free, fair and credible primary.
