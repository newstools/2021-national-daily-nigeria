The 34 Artillery Brigade  Commander at Obinze, Owerri, Imo has received DSS intelligence on how IPO is moving explosives and bombs from Lagos to Orlu in the southeastern state.
The secret police stated that it received intelligence that the explosives were being moved in articulated trucks from Lagos to the hideout.
In a letter referenced S.238/5/1538 dated April 26, 2021, and signed by I. Abdullah on behalf of the Imo State DSS Director, the department the bombs and other IEDS are meant to further destabilized Imo.
“It was reliably gathered that the newly acquired items are currently being conveyed from Lagos to an unconfirmed location in Orlu Local Government Area.
“The items are being concealed in articulated/heavy duty vehicles to beat security checks along the road. It was further revealed that the group intends to deploy the explosives in their planned attacks on security/government installations across the state,” the letter stated.
The DSS then advised the Brigade commander to ensure that deployed security personnel carried out thorough search on trucks coming to the state.
But IPOB denied the allegation. that it was moving arms and other weaponry into Imo to destabilise the state.
The group’s Director of Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, told the Punch what the DSS is saying is a huge lie.
“There is no iota of truth in what that Federal Government-sponsored Zoo and Caliphate agent is saying,” he said.
