The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) on Monday sanctioned Channels Television, suspending the operation of the station and imposing a fine of N5 million for breaching the broadcast code.
The Acting Director-General of the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), Prof. Armstrong Idachaba, in a letter to the Managing Director of Channels Television, referred to Channels TV 7.00pm live broadcast programme of Sunday, 25th April 2021, accusing Channels TV of providing the station to a leader of the Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB) to make secessionist and inciting declarations on air without caution or reprimand by the station contrary to the broadcast code. The NBC also chastised Channels TV of allowing the guest to make derogatory, false and misleading statements about the Nigerian Army, even when the group had been proscribed by a court of law.
