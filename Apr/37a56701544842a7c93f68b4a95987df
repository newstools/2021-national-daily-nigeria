The global Personal Computer (PC) market for the first quarter (Q1) of this year has recorded the strongest year-on-year growth in two decades considering the weak Q1 performance in 2020, data by the global research and advisory firm Gartner showed.
In the Q1 of 2021, worldwide PC shipments totaled 69.9 million units, up 32 per cent year on year, the companyâ€™s preliminary results showed.
Gartner said the growth was the fastest since the company began tracking the PC market in 2000.
The firm said that the Chinese PC market has experienced a particularly high year-on-year growth in the first three months of the year, with the growth rate reaching 70 per cent.
Global PC giant Lenovo remained the top vendor by shipments in Q1 this year, with its global market share reaching 25.1 per cent and shipments totaling 17.55 million units.
