After the April 24 attack that killed eight security agents, including soldiers stationed at different check points in Port Harcourt, unidentified gunmen have again killed five soldiers.
The fresh attack happened at Omelema community, Abia Local Government Area of Rivers State.
In the latest attack, the gunmen came from a nearby river, shot indiscriminately, and went straight to a lodge where the soldiers were camped and opened fire, killing two on the spot about 11pm on Monday.
There is no official response yet from the military authorities.
But security agency chiefs in Rivers had a meeting at the headquarters of the State Police Command along Moscow Road in Port Harcourt early in the day.
