Candidates of the All progressives Congress (APC) disqualified from contesting the local government elections in Rivers State, have expressed their grievances against the state party leadership.
The candidates and supporters of Senator Magnus Abe said fresh doom was looming in Rivers APC.
Speaking at the Freedom House, Port Harcourt, on Friday, they said it was worrisome their disqualification came following a letter written to the Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission (RSIEC) by Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi.
The disqualified APC candidate from Degema Local Government, Ilamabo Mirilla, who read the statement on behalf of others, alleged the Minister and leader of APC in Rivers, in the letter to RSIEC told the commission that the party would not be part of the election.
They described the action of the Minister as unfortunate, saying the development occurred after they had perfected all modalities required to partake in the poll scheduled for April 17.
According to them, the recent judgement of the Supreme Court, which authenticated the legality of Amaechi’s camp’s executive committee, did not announce their disqualification from the poll.
They said: “For a party that has not won any major election since its founding in the state, and, in fact, did not participate in the 2019 general elections, the writing to RSIEC to stop us is pointer to a deeper political malaise in our beloved party, which malaise, if not excised, will spell doom for the party soon”.
They urged the national leadership of APC to stop sitting on the fence in matters affecting the party in Rivers under the leadership of the Minister.
