The new audition set for May 3 to May 16 is exclusive to Nigerians above 21 and will be virtual in line with Covid-19 safety measures.
According to the organisers, interested participants are expected to record a two-minute video, stating why they should be picked to be a housemate in season 6 of BBNaija.
Participants of the initially announced early auditions have been advised not to participate in the new auditions.
