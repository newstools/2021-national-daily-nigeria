The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) at the weekend lamented the killing of ESN operatives defending local communities in the southeast against terrorists and killer herdsmen by the Nigerian security personnel, warning that such killing may bring out the madness in IPOB members. The group cautioned against ESN operatives being hunted like games every day. IPOB lamented that the world is keeping quiet over the atrocity “until we begin our own madness.”
The Nigerian security had on Saturday revealed that a combined team of the police, the Nigerian Army and Department of State Services (DSS) killed IPOB’s Commander, Ikonso and 6 other militia members in Imo State. The victims were said to be killed in an early morning raid on their hideout at Awomama, Oru East Local Government Area, Imo State, on Saturday.
IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, in a statement on Saturday, declared: “the killing of the heroic innocent Biafrans protecting our communities and towns from Fulani terrorists herdsmen masquerading as cattle herders in cold blood is very painful.”
The IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, said that Ikonso was killed because of his refusal to head the regional security outfit, Ebubeagu, established last week by the five southeast governors.
The IPOB spokesman declared: “Fulani terrorists pretending as cattle sellers in Enugu destroyed Police van and attacked Government officials on lawful duty with AK-47 but no Army, police or DSS attacked them till now. But ESN operatives defending our communities against the terrorists are being hunted like games every day. The world has kept quiet over this atrocity until we begin our own madness.”
