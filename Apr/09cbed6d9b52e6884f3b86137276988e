The Zonal Police Headquarters Zone 13 in Ukpo, Anambra, was up in flames early on Monday as armed hoodlums numbering about 20 invaded the facility.
Eyewitnesses said some offices and vehicles were burn as gunshots rang all over the premises.
The intention of the attackers is not yet known, but assaults on policemen and police institutions have been recurring in the southeast.
A similar incident happened in Abia today.
But chances are the hoodlums, which police authorities named as the Eastern Security Network members (mainly IPOB agitators) are after the police arsenals.
The Imo incident early in April targeted the police headquarters armoury.
The Anambra invaders were also prevented from accessing the weapons, according to reports.
No fewer than six police installations have been attacked so far in the southeast.
Thereâ€™s no official statement on the Monday incident yet.
