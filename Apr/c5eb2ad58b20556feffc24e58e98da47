A crossdresser filming his skit in got a rude shock as hoodlums descended on him somewhere on the street of Lagos.
Black Barbie of Africa got the raw treatment whose video has been trending since April 20 while producing his skit in Lagos.
Skits are supposed to trend and command eyeballs in this attention economy that accommodates any kind of performance.
So the adversity might carry its own seed of blessing for this particular member of the LGBQT community.
In the video trending online, Black Barbie of Africa, whose real name is Nsogbudii was all tears as six men surrounded him, and tore off his drag, and drenched his bare body.
He never saw it coming.
“I don’t know what I did to deserve what they did to me yesterday. I am so depressed. I don’t know what I would do to get out of this shame,” he said in the video.
“Look at the public disgrace that they gave me. They tore my clothes and beat me for doing nothing. Thank God for my friend who was helping me with the shooting and captured them while they beat me.”

Gender-bending and same sex relationship are crimes in Nigeria, and Nigerians, mostly youth, of that sexual orientation are either arrested or mobbed.
The law criminalizing it, Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act
Nsogbudii becomes the sixth queer Nigeria has, coming ehind Bobrisky, Jmaes Brown. Bryan Nwakoro, Jay Boogie, and Jay Buggati, in that order.
In spite of the law, these crossdressers have refused to be closeted.
