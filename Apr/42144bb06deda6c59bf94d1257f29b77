A sociopolitical organization, World Igbo Peoples Assembly, WIPAS, has advised the Army to go after killer herdsmen in Igbo land, and stop alleged killings of innocent Nigerians in some parts of Akwa Ibom and Benue States.
In a statement by its Board of Trustees, BoT chairman, Mazi Chuks Ibegbu, on Saturday, WIPAS called on the Nigerian Army to rather face the killer herdsmen, Boko Haram and bandits in the North.
“The killer herdsmen are in our forest and our army should go and flush them out and not waste time looking for IPOB and ESN,” the group said.
The body warned the Army not to do anything that will cause social anarchy in Nigeria by its seeming sympathy to any group in the country against others.
WIPAS also took a swipe at some misguided Nigerians that issued quit notices to fellow Nigerians, noting that such elements should be arrested and made to face the law for treason.
“No such quit notice will happen in Igbo land, a home for all Nigerians and black race except killer herdsmen and evil people. These illegal quit notices have occurred in the North, West and recently in the Calabar area”.
WIPAS insisted that the narrow rail gauge which the Minister of Transport Rotimi Amaechi allegedly deceived the President to award in the East must be reversed to Standard gauge, lampooning the Minister for such crime against his own people.
“Today, there are Transport University, Air force University, Army University and now standard rail gauge in the west and from Nigeria to Maradi in Niger republic. Amaechi did not deem it fit to at least recommend a standard rail gauge for his people in the East,” the group lamented.
It warned against labelling every Igbo youth as Indigeneous People of Biafra IPOB, or Eastern Security Network ESN, just as Northern youths cannot all be labelled as Boko Haram or Fulani killer herdsmen.
