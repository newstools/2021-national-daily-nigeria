There are emerging indications that tension may have gripped the Nigerian presidency after the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru, submitted documents containing executive summary of arms deals to the House of Representatives ad-hoc Committee investigating arms purchase by the Nigerian Armed Forces in the recent times.
The committee had been mandated by the House to investigate the purchase, use, and control of arms, ammunition, and related hardware by the military, paramilitary, and other law enforcement agencies in Nigeria after the National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, was, in March, cited to have revealed on BBC Hausa interview that the funds for acquisition of arms have been diverted. The NSA, however, later explained that he was misquoted in the report when the reported revelation began to raise dust in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) government.
Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru, who is only about two months in office and is still settling down as the Chief of Army Staff, presented the document to the House committee but declined making any explanation, insisting that the document is self-explanatory.
Lieutenant General Attahiru had protested that he is yet  to settle down in office, insisted that he is not the right person to speak on arms and ammunition purchased by the former Chief of Army Staff. Apparently, the current COAS was not prepared to defend the actions of his predecessor which has been the practice over the years, considering that government is a continum. He had insisted that the House committee should invite those who were involved in the arms purchases.
