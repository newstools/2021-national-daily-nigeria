The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee in Abuja on Thursday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency on national security, as the country has been plunged into intractable insecurity in various states of the federation. The party decried the growing spate of attacks and kidnappings across the country.
PDP National Publicity Secretary,  Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement indicated that the PDP in a communiqué at the end of an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) declared support for the call by the House of Representatives for the President to urgently fix the worsening insecurity.
The statement read in part: “NEC urged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately declare a national state of emergency on security.
“NEC also urged President Buhari to, without delay, convoke a national conference on Security so as to galvanize ideas and options to tackle insecurity in our country.
“NEC lamented the heightened insecurity pervading all parts of our nation due primarily to the misrule of President Muhammadu Buhari and All Progressives Congress as well as their failure to decisively tackle the menace of terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, bloodletting and acts of violence in our country.
“NEC further commended the efforts of governors, senators, House of Representatives members and other officials elected on the platform of the PDP in forcefully seeking solutions to the spate of insecurity in our country.”
The party lamented that Nigeria has become threatened by diverse insecurity manifestations, particularly, the Boko Haram terrorism in the northeast, banditry in the northwest, killer herdsmen invasion of communities killing and destroying farmland in the southwest, southeast and other parts of the country, separatist agitations in the southeast and southwest, etc.
The security situation has become deplorable since the emergence of a new gang widely referred to as unknown gunmen who specialize in attacking and destroying security facilities and killing security personnel with minimum resistance by the government institutions.
