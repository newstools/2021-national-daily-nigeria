The Federal Government, on Thursday, distributed free 40 agricultural pollination service starter packs to fruit and vegetable farmers as well as bee keepers in Edo.
The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, while distributing the items, expressed the federal government’s commitment to ensuring food security in the country through various programmes, aimed at empowering farmers.
Nanono, represented by Mr Obasi Ikenefuna, a Director in the Department of Horticulture, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, said that pollination services had the ability to increase fruit and crop potentials by 40 to 50 per cent.
According to him, the distribution of the starter packs is to ensure that farmers across the 18 local government areas of the state embrace pollination services to improve their yields.
“After collecting these starter packs, don’t go and sell them, but ensure you make use of them to improve productivity and create wealth.
“They will help you to increase your income and we are also going to teach you how to use and maintain them,” he said.
Also speaking, the state Director of Agriculture (FEMARD), Mr Wellington Omoragbon, assured that the beneficiaries would be monitored to ensure that they put the starter packs to use.
“The faces I’m seeing here are all responsible; these are not people that will go and sell the starter packs or dump them in one corner.
“Agric is a business. We want to know after now what you have been able to do with these starter packs.
“It is only when you succeed that the ministry can decide to extend the programme to others,” he said.
In his remarks, Mr Ekhosayator Iyobosaro, a farmer, thanked the federal government for the support and encouragement given to farmers through various agricultural programmes in the state.
Iyobosaro, however, called on all governments at all levels to provide security for farmers across the country.
