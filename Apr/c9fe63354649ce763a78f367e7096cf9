Igangan, a sleepy town in Ibarapa north, got a rude jolt April 2 as herdsmen slashed the two arms of a farmer who resisted their cattle grazing on his farm.
The incident took place at Isokun around 2pm.
The victim, Ojedokun Modede, is a retired principal who went into agribusiness to keep himself productive in retirement.
According to Taiwo Adeogun, the secretary to the farmers union in Ibarapaland, Modede  is now hospitalized at a private hospital in Igangan. The machete cut to his two wrists may debilitate him finally.
Many had thought the farmer-herder crisis raging in that part of Oyo was a bygone after Serikin Fulani Abdukadir Salihu was frozen out of the town by Igangan’s youth on Jan 26.
Staggered attacks, however, have returned to the town and its environs since March.
“Police authorities at Iganagan and Ayete have been informed of the latest attack,” Adeogun told the National Daily.
