The Nigerian Young Farmers Network (NYFN) has urged all tiers of government to give priority to farmers’ security in order to achieve high yield of crops for consumption and exportation.
Mr Promise Amahah, Director-General of NYFN made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja.
Amahah frowned at the continuous hike in prices of food across the country, attributing the hike to the surge in armed banditry, kidnapping and other related crimes.
He noted that the vices had made many farmers abandon their farms.
Amahah said that security measures by the government would sustain the growing interest of young people in farming.
According to him, if bankers, oil and gas workers can feel safe at work, farmers must enjoy the same access to security services.
“Safer farms must be treated as a matter of priority if high yields for local consumption and export purposes will be achieved in Nigeria.
“This will also sustain the growing interest of young people in farming.
“We at NYFN find it quite worrisome that a rising trend in kidnap of young people could not be curtailed by the relevant security agencies.
“We urge the relevant security agencies to deepen their intelligence gathering efforts and consider partnering with rural farmers and hunters in this regard,” Amahah said.
According to him, just like the civilian joint task force, a special unit for community based farm security should be established in the short term.
“As Nigeria’s young farmers network, we are disposed to complement efforts from the government in addressing security challenges by mobilising our members nationwide to serve as farm security extension workers,” Amahah said.
